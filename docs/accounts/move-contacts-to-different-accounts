TODO Multiple RawContacts linked to a single Contact

Let's take a look at what happens when the AOSP Contacts, Google Contacts, and Samsung Contacts
apps moves RawContacts to different Accounts. I used a physical Samsung Galaxy A71 API 33 to run
Samsung Contacts. For AOSP Contacts and Google Contacts, I used an emulator Pixel 4 API 30.

For simplicity, I setup my test devices/emulators with two remote Accounts; X and Y. This allows me
to test all different cases when moving a RawContact from its current account to the target account.

| **Current Account** | **Target Account** |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| null (local)        | X                  |
| X                   | null (local)       |
| X                   | Y                  |
