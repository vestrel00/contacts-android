They do this to fetch the data per contact. This means that if there are  1,000 matching contacts, then an extra 1,000 internal database queries are performed!  This is not cool!</p> <p>To address this issue, the query APIs provided in the Contacts, Reborn library, perform only at  least two internal database queries no matter how many contacts are matched! Even if there are  10,000 contacts matched, the library will only perform two internal database queries (depending on  your query parameters). Fetch 10,000 contacts as fast as 99 milliseconds (varies per device)!</p> <p>\u2139\ufe0f For more info, read Optimizing queries.</p> <p>Of course, if you don't want to fetch all hundreds of thousands of contacts, the query APIs support  pagination with <code>limit</code> and <code>offset</code> functions!</p> <p>Cancellations are also supported! To cancel a query amid execution,</p> <pre><code>.find { returnTrueIfQueryShouldBeCancelled() }\n</code></pre> <p>The find function optionally takes in a function that, if it returns true, will cancel query  processing as soon as possible. The function is called numerous times during query processing to  check if processing should stop or continue. This gives you the option to cancel the query.</p> <p>This is useful when used in multi-threaded environments. One scenario where this would be frequently  used is when performing queries as the user types a search text. You are able to cancel the current query when the user enters new text.</p> <p>For example, to automatically cancel the query inside a Kotlin coroutine when the coroutine is  cancelled,</p> <pre><code>launch {\n    withContext(coroutineContext) {\n        val contacts = query.find { !isActive }\n    }\n    // Or, using the coroutine extensions in the async module...\n    val contacts = query.findWithContext()\n}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"#all-core-apis-are-framework-agnostic-and-works-well-with-java-and-kotlin","title":"All core APIs are framework-agnostic and works well with Java and Kotlin","text":"<p>The API does not and will not force you to use any frameworks (e.g. RxJava or Coroutines/Flow)! All core functions of the API live in the <code>core</code> module, which you can import to your project all by itself. Don't believe me? Take a look at the dependencies in the <code>core/build.gradle</code> :D </p> <p>So, feel free to use the core API however you want with whatever libraries or frameworks you want,  such as Reactive, Coroutines/Flow, AsyncTask (hope not), WorkManager, and whatever permissions  handling APIs you want to use.</p> <p>All other modules in this library are optional and are just there for your convenience or for reference.</p> <p>I also made sure that all core functions and entities are interoperable with Java. So, if  you were wondering why I\u2019m using a semi-builder pattern instead of using named arguments with  default values, that is why.

Is the lookup key of the Contact affected? Yes. The Contact,  RawContacts, and Data rows have been deleted and new rows have been created to replace them! This  means that all IDs have changed. The Contact lookup key and the RawContacts source ID also changed.</p> <p>Local contact's lookup key may change but row ID remain the same!</p> <p>The ContactsProvider may assign a different value to the Contact lookup key if it's constituent RawContacts that are not associated with an Account (local, unsynced, source id is null) gets its primary display name source updated.

Same idea can be used to transform an Account-associated RawContact to a local RawContact. Perhaps we can implement some functions in this library that does these things?

Shortcuts and pitfalls.","text":"<p>One thing that may come to mind in attempts to reduce lines of seemingly duplicate code is to have just a mutable implementation of an immutable declaration.

Keep in mind that <code>val</code> only requires getters whereas <code>var</code> requires both getters and setters. Therefore, a <code>var</code> cannot be overridden by a  <code>val</code>. Or maybe there is a different reason Kotlin imposes this restriction. On a similar note,  the <code>List</code> interface can be overridden to a <code>MutableList</code>.</p> <p>We, as API contributors, can avoid having to write seemingly duplicate functions and extensions!</p> <p>However! Can you see what's wrong with this setup? If we do this, we would either be deceiving consumers to think that the instances of \"immutable\" class signatures (i.e. <code>Contact</code>, <code>RawContact</code>, and <code>Address</code>) are actually immutable OR we would have to let consumers know that the API does not really provide true immutability. Neither option is ideal (nor is it acceptable IMO).</p> <p>Consumers would have a reference to a <code>Contact</code>, which they may assume is immutable because of the usage of <code>val</code> instead of <code>var</code>, but in actuality the underlying implementation is mutable... This could be a cause of really hard to find bugs in multi-threaded usage. Consumers may use <code>Contact</code> with the assumption that it is immutable only to find that it can actually be mutated! We could fix this by just making the mutable implementation thread-safe but since that is the only implementation, consumers will be forced to use thread-safe code when they don't have to thereby negatively affecting performance.</p> <p>Keep in mind that thread safety is only one of several reasons for immutability. Those other reasons will be violated too.</p> <p>Consumers will be shocked if they ever do the following or something similar.</p> <pre><code>fun x(contact: Contact) = when(contact) {\n    is MutableContact -&gt; {} // this is always true\n    is Contact -&gt; {} // this is always true\n}\n</code></pre> <p>In any case, I have to admit, it is a nice trick that would save API contributors time.

Thankfully none of this stuff is difficult! </p> <p>Here are the steps, in chronological order, on how to define and use your own custom data,</p> <ol> <li>Define the mimetype</li> <li>Define the entities</li> <li>Define the fields</li> <li>Implement the cursor</li> <li>Implement the mapper</li> <li>Implement the operation</li> <li>Define the count restriction</li> <li>Define RawContact getters and setters</li> <li>Define Contact getters and setters</li> <li>Define exceptions</li> <li>Implement the field mapper</li> <li>Define the data query function</li> <li>Define the custom data entry</li> <li>Define the custom data entry registration</li> <li>Register your custom data with the Contacts API instance</li> <li>Use your custom data in queries, inserts, updates, and deletes</li> </ol> <p>\u2139\ufe0f Maybe someday someone with code generation experience (or I'll learn how to do it), will create annotations and annotation processors to eliminate having to manually write this stuff =) There's actually an issue for this if anyone wants to take it! https://github.com/vestrel00/contacts-android/issues/210</p> <p>To help illustrate the above steps, we'll use the <code>HandleName</code> and <code>Gender</code> custom data provided in this library's <code>customdata-handlename</code> and <code>customdata-gender</code> respectively as an example.</p> <p>\u2139\ufe0f For more specifics on these custom data, read Integrate the gender custom data and Integrate the handle name custom data.</p> <p>At the bottom of this page, we'll also discuss,</p> <ul> <li>Consider adding your custom data to this library</li> <li>Custom data without sync adapters will not be synced</li> <li>Displaying your custom data in other Contacts apps</li> <li>Summary of limitations</li> </ul> <p>\u2139\ufe0f Some of the code used in these examples are in Kotlin.

This is optional.

The first criteria for being able to show your custom data in the Contacts app is to define and implement your own sync adapter. If you do not have a sync adapter implementation, your custom data will not be shown in the Contacts app! Again, this library does not provide any sync adapters. That is for you to implement based on your account services. This library provides you and users of your library an easy, uniform way to perform read and write operations on your custom data. The act of syncing is up to you.</p> <p>The official documentation on custom data rows is as follows,</p> <p>By creating and using your own custom MIME types, you can insert, edit, delete, and retrieve your  own data rows in the <code>ContactsContract.Data</code> table. Your rows are limited to using the column  defined in <code>ContactsContract.DataColumns</code>, although you can map your own type-specific column  names to the default column names. In the device's contacts application, the data for your rows  is displayed but can't be edited or deleted, and users can't add additional data. To allow users  to modify your custom data rows, you must provide an editor activity in your own application.</p> <p>To display your custom data, provide a <code>contacts.xml</code> file containing a <code>&lt;ContactsAccountType&gt;</code>  element and one or more of its <code>&lt;ContactsDataKind&gt;</code> child elements. This is described in more  detail in the section <code>&lt;ContactsDataKind&gt;</code> element.</p> <p>Let's break down the official documentation.</p> <ul> <li>Contacts applications such as the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) Contacts app (the default    Contacts app that comes with a vanilla version of Android) and the Google Contacts app    (and other Contacts app that support this feature) shows custom data from other apps when viewing    contact details. </li> <li>Custom data from other apps are viewable but not editable in order to preserve and respect the    rules surrounding those custom data managed by other apps. </li> </ul> <p>This library allows you to read (query) and write (insert, update, delete) custom data from other  apps. It is up to you whether you want to follow the same limitations imposed by the AOSP and  Google Contacts app.</p> <p>In order to show your custom data in the AOSP Contacts app and Google Contacts app (and other  Contacts app that support this feature), you must add an xml file in your app; <code>res/xml/contacts.xml</code>.

Is the lookup key of the Contact affected? Yes. The Contact, RawContacts, and Data rows have been deleted and new rows have been created to replace them! This means that all IDs have changed. The Contact lookup key and the RawContacts source ID also changed.</p> <p>Local contact's lookup key may change but row ID remain the same!</p> <p>The ContactsProvider may assign a different value to the Contact lookup key if it's constituent RawContacts that are not associated with an Account (local, unsynced, source id is null) gets its primary display name source updated. Display name sources are specified in <code>ContactsContract.DisplayNameSources</code>. In order of increasing priority; email, phone, organization, nickname, and name.</p> <p>This suggests that the lookup key for local contacts depends on the primary display name.

It is considered out of scope of this library as it requires access to remote databases and account-specific data. Let's talk about it though since it is good to know how it works if you just want more insight.</p> <p>https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/contacts-provider#SyncAdapters</p> <p>The Contacts Provider is specifically designed for handling synchronization of contacts data between a device and an online service. This allows users to download existing data to a new device and upload existing data to a new account. Synchronization also ensures that users have the latest data at hand, regardless of the source of additions and changes. Another advantage of synchronization is that it makes contacts data available even when the device is not connected to the network.</p> <p>Although you can implement synchronization in a variety of ways, the Android system provides a plug-in synchronization framework that automates the following tasks:</p> <ul> <li>Checking network availability.</li> <li>Scheduling and executing synchronization, based on user preferences.</li> <li>Restarting synchronizations that have stopped.</li> </ul> <p>To use this framework, you supply a sync adapter plug-in. Each sync adapter is unique to a service and content provider, but can handle multiple account names for the same service. The framework also allows multiple sync adapters for the same service and provider.</p> <p>This library does not provide any sync adapters. Instead, it relies on existing sync adapters to do the syncing. Sync adapters and syncing are really out of scope of this library. Syncing is its own thing that typically happens outside of an application UI. This library is focused on Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on native and custom data to and from the local database. Syncing the local database to and from a remote database in the background is a totally different story altogether.</p> <p>\u2139\ufe0f For more info, read Integrate custom data.</p>"},{"location":"groups/delete-groups/","title":"Delete groups","text":"<p>This library provides the <code>GroupsDelete</code> API that allows you to delete existing Groups.</p> <p>An instance of the <code>GroupsDelete</code> API is obtained by,</p> <pre><code>val delete = Contacts(context).groups().delete()\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"groups/delete-groups/#a-basic-delete","title":"A basic delete","text":"<p>To delete a set of existing groups,</p> <pre><code>val deleteResult = Contacts(context)\n    .groups()\n    .delete()\n    .groups(existingGroups)\n    .commit()\n</code></pre> <p>To delete a set of existing groups using IDs,</p> <pre><code>val deleteResult = Contacts(context)\n    .groups()\n    .delete()\n    .groupsWithId(1, 2, 3)\n    .commit()\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"groups/delete-groups/#an-advanced-delete","title":"An advanced delete","text":"<p>You may specify a matching criteria, like in queries, that will delete all matching groups,</p> <pre><code>val deleteResult = delete\n    .groupsWhere { AccountType equalTo \"com.google\" }\n    .commit()\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"groups/delete-groups/#executing-the-delete","title":"Executing the delete","text":"<p>To execute the delete,</p> <pre><code>.commit()\n</code></pre> <p>To delete all given groups in a single atomic transaction,</p> <pre><code>.commitInOneTransaction()\n</code></pre> <p>The call to <code>commitInOneTransaction</code> will only succeed if ALL given groups are successfully deleted.

These are done automatically by the Contacts Provider during the link operation.</p> <p>What is not done automatically by the Contacts Provider is that the name row of former Contact X is set as the default. The AOSP Contacts app does this manually. The Contacts Providers automatically sets the Contact display name to whatever the default name row is for the Contact, if available. For more info on Contact display name resolution, read the Contact Display Name and Default Name Rows section.</p> <p>\u2139\ufe0f Display name resolution is different for APIs below 21 (pre-lollipop).</p> <p>The display name of the RawContacts remain the same.</p> <p>The Groups table remains unmodified.</p> <p>Options updates</p> <p>Changes to the options (starred, timesContacted, lastTimeContacted, customRingtone, and sendToVoicemail) of a RawContact may affect the options of the parent Contact. On the other hand, changes to the options of the parent Contact will be propagated to all child RawContact options.</p> <p>Photo updates</p> <p>A RawContact may have a full-sized photo saved as a file and a thumbnail version of that saved in the Data table in a photo mimetype row. A Contact's full-sized photo and thumbnail are simply references to the \"chosen\" RawContact's full-sized photo and thumbnail (though the URIs may differ).</p> <p>\u2139\ufe0f When removing the photo in the AOSP contacts app, the photo data row is not immediately  deleted, though the <code>PHOTO_FILE_ID</code> is immediately set to null. This may result in the <code>PHOTO_URI</code> and <code>PHOTO_THUMBNAIL_URI</code> to still have a valid image uri even though the photo has been  \"removed\". This library immediately deletes the photo data row, which seems to work perfectly.</p> <p>Data inserts</p> <p>In the AOSP Contacts app, Data inserted in combined (raw) contacts mode will be associated to the first RawContact in the list sorted by the RawContact ID.</p> <p>\u2139\ufe0f This may not be the same as the RawContact referenced by <code>ContactsColumns.NAME_RAW_CONTACT_ID</code>.</p> <p>UI changes?</p> <p>The AOSP Contacts App does not display the groups field when displaying / editing Contacts that have multiple RawContacts (linked/merged/joined) in combined mode. However, it does allow editing individual RawContact Data rows in which case the groups field is displayed and editable.</p> <p>In the AOSP Contacts app, the name attribute used comes from the name row with IS_SUPER_PRIMARY set to true. This and all other \"unique\" mimetypes (organization) and non-unique mimetypes (email) per RawContact are shown only if they are not blank.</p> <p>Showing multiple RawContact's data in the same edit screen (combined mode)</p> <p>In older version of the AOSP, Android Open Source Project (AOSP) Contacts app, data from multiple RawContacts was being shown in the same edit screen. This caused a lot of confusion about which data belonged to which RawContact. Newer versions of AOSP Contacts only allow editing one RawContact at a time to avoid confusion.

The same thing occurred. This means that the  character limit is imposed on the number but perhaps not the name OR maybe the name has not reached  the maximum. I tried inserting a name with over 100 characters and it failed. So there is a  character limit for the name. I tried inserting names of shorter and shorter lengths until I find the max.

The Samsung yielded the same results as the Nexus. So, perhaps it is just the self-imposed limitation of the BLU phone.</p> <p>One interesting difference between the Samsung and the Nexus is that our <code>SimContactsInsert</code> was indicating that the insert succeeded in the Samsung even though no new row was created in the SIM table (oh Samsung lol). The result Uri returned by the insert operation is null in the Nexus but not null in the Samsung.</p> <p>What this all means? </p> <ul> <li>Our <code>SimContactsInsert</code> and <code>SimContactsUpdate</code> APIs need to be able to detect the maximum    character limits for the <code>name</code> and <code>number</code> before performing the actual insert or update    operation. </li> <li>To figure out the max character limits, we can attempt to insert a string of length 30 (most     names should fit there and most SIM cards have lower limits). Keep attempting to insert until     insert succeeds (query if the row is actually created instead of just relying on the insert      result), making the string shorter each time. Delete the successful insert and record the      length of the string. <ul> <li>Do this for both <code>name</code> and <code>number</code> and store the results in shared preferences mapped to a    unique ID of the SIM card. We do not want to do this calculation everytime our APIs are used!</li> </ul> </li> <li>Max character limits should be exposed our users via a public API.</li> <li>Furthermore, we cannot rely on the result of the insert operation alone.
