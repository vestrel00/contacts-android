You are still able to install all modules by specifying them individually. For more info about the different modules and dependency resolution management, read the Installation guide . Setup \u00b6 There is no setup required. It's up to you how you want to create and retain instances of the contacts.core.Contacts(context) API. For more info, read Contacts API Setup . It is also useful to read about API Entities . Quick Start \u00b6 To retrieve all contacts containing all available contact data, val contacts = Contacts ( context ). query (). find () To simply search for Contacts, yielding the exact same results as the AOSP Contacts app, val contacts = Contacts ( context ) . broadQuery () . wherePartiallyMatches ( searchText ) . find () \u2139\ufe0f For more info, read Query contacts . Something a bit more advanced... To retrieve the first 5 contacts (including only the contact id, display name, and phone numbers in the results) ordered by display name in descending order, matching ALL of these rules; - a first name starting with \"leo\" - has emails from gmail or hotmail - lives in the US - has been born prior to making this query - is favorited (starred) - has a nickname of \"DarEdEvil\" (case sensitive) - works for Facebook - has a note - belongs to the account of \"john.doe@gmail.com\" or \"john.doe@myspace.com\" val contacts = Contacts ( context ) . query () . where { ( Name . GivenName startsWith \"leo\" ) and ( Email . Address { endsWith ( \"gmail.com\" ) or endsWith ( \"hotmail.com\" ) }) and ( Address . Country equalToIgnoreCase \"us\" ) and ( Event { ( Date lessThan Date (). toWhereString ()) and ( Type equalTo EventEntity . Type . BIRTHDAY ) }) and ( Contact . Options . Starred equalTo true ) and ( Nickname . Name equalTo \"DarEdEvil\" ) and ( Organization . Company `in` listOf ( \"facebook\" , \"FB\" )) and ( Note . Note . isNotNullOrEmpty ()) } . accounts ( Account ( \"john.doe@gmail.com\" , \"com.google\" ), Account ( \"john.doe@myspace.com\" , \"com.myspace\" ), ) . include { setOf ( Contact . Id , Contact . DisplayNamePrimary , Phone . Number ) } . orderBy ( ContactsFields . DisplayNamePrimary . desc ()) . offset ( 0 ) . limit ( 5 ) . find () \u2139\ufe0f For more info, read Query contacts (advanced) . Once you have the contacts, you now have access to all of their data! val contact : Contact Log . d ( \"Contact\" , \"\"\" ID: ${ contact . id } Lookup Key: ${ contact . lookupKey } Display name: ${ contact . displayNamePrimary } Display name alt: ${ contact . displayNameAlt } Photo Uri: ${ contact . photoUri } Thumbnail Uri: ${ contact . photoThumbnailUri } Last updated: ${ contact . lastUpdatedTimestamp } Starred?: ${ contact . options ?. starred } Send to voicemail?: ${ contact . options ?. sendToVoicemail } Ringtone: ${ contact . options ?. customRingtone } Aggregate data from all RawContacts of the contact ----------------------------------- Addresses: ${ contact . addressList () } Emails: ${ contact . emailList () } Events: ${ contact . eventList () } Group memberships: ${ contact . groupMembershipList () } IMs: ${ contact . imList () } Names: ${ contact . nameList () } Nicknames: ${ contact . nicknameList () } Notes: ${ contact . noteList () } Organizations: ${ contact . organizationList () } Phones: ${ contact . phoneList () } Relations: ${ contact . relationList () } SipAddresses: ${ contact . sipAddressList () } Websites: ${ contact . websiteList () } ----------------------------------- \"\"\" . trimIndent () // There are also aggregate data functions that return a sequence instead of a list. ) \u2139\ufe0f For more info, read about API Entities . More than enough APIs that will allow you to build your own contacts app! \u00b6 This library is capable of doing more than just querying contacts. Actually, you can build your own full-fledged contacts app with it! Let's take a look at a few other APIs this library provides... To get the first 20 gmail emails ordered by email address in descending order, val emails = Contacts ( context ) . data () . query () . emails () . where { Email . Address endsWith \"gmail.com\" } . orderBy ( Fields . Email . Address . desc ( ignoreCase = true )) . offset ( 0 ) . limit ( 20 ) . find () It's not just for emails. It's for all data kinds (including custom data). \u2139\ufe0f For more info, read Query specific data kinds . To CREATE/INSERT a contact with a name of \"John Doe\" who works at Amazon with a work email of \"john.doe@amazon.com\" (in Kotlin), val insertResult = Contacts ( context ) . insert () . rawContacts ( NewRawContact (). apply { name = NewName (). apply { givenName = \"John\" familyName = \"Doe\" } organization = NewOrganization (). apply { company = \"Amazon\" title = \"Superstar\" } emails . add ( NewEmail (). apply { address = \"john.doe@amazon.com\" type = EmailEntity . Type . WORK }) }) . commit () Or alternatively, in a more Kotlinized style using named arguments, val insertResult = Contacts ( context ) . insert () . rawContacts ( NewRawContact ( name = NewName ( givenName = \"John\" , familyName = \"Doe\" ), organization = NewOrganization ( company = \"Amazon\" , title = \"Superstar\" ), emails = mutableListOf ( NewEmail ( address = \"john.doe@amazon.com\" , type = EmailEntity . Type . WORK )) )) . commit () Or alternatively, using extension functions, val insertResult = Contacts ( context ) . insert () . rawContact { setName { givenName = \"John\" familyName = \"Doe\" } setOrganization { company = \"Amazon\" title = \"Superstar\" } addEmail { address = \"john.doe@amazon.com\" type = EmailEntity . Type . WORK } } . commit () \u2139\ufe0f For more info, read Insert contacts . If John Doe switches jobs and heads over to Microsoft, we can UPDATE his data, Contacts ( context ) . update () . contacts ( johnDoe . mutableCopy { setOrganization { company = \"Microsoft\" title = \"Newb\" } emails (). first (). apply { address = \"john.doe@microsoft.com\" } }) . commit () \u2139\ufe0f For more info, read Update contacts . If we no longer like John Doe, we can DELETE him from our life, Contacts ( context ) . delete () . contacts ( johnDoe ) . commit () \u2139\ufe0f For more info, read Delete Contacts . Threading and permissions \u00b6 This library provides Kotlin coroutine extensions in the permissions module for all API functions to handle permissions and async module for executing work in background threads. launch { val contacts = Contacts ( context ) . queryWithPermission () ... . findWithContext () val deferredResult = Contacts ( context ) . insertWithPermission () ... . commitAsync () val result = deferredResult . await () } \u2139\ufe0f For more info, read Permissions handling using coroutines and Execute work outside of the UI thread using coroutines . So, if we call the above function and we don't yet have permission. The user will be prompted to give the appropriate permissions before the query proceeds. Then, the work is done in the coroutine context of choice (default is Dispatchers.IO). If the user does not give permission, the query will return no results. \u2139\ufe0f Extensions for Kotlin Flow and RxJava are also in the project roadmap, which includes APIs for listening to Contacts database changes. Full documentation, guides, and samples \u00b6 The above examples barely scratches the surface of what this library provides. For more in-depth documentation, visit the GitHub Pages . For a sample app reference, take a look at and run the sample module. All APIs in the library are optimized! \u00b6 Some other APIs or util functions out there typically perform one internal database query per contact returned. They do this to fetch the data per contact. This means that if there are 1,000 matching contacts, then an extra 1,000 internal database queries are performed! This is not cool! To address this issue, the query APIs provided in the Contacts, Reborn library, perform only at least two internal database queries no matter how many contacts are matched! Even if there are 10,000 contacts matched, the library will only perform two internal database queries (depending on your query parameters). Fetch 10,000 contacts as fast as 99 milliseconds (varies per device)! \u2139\ufe0f For more info, read Optimizing queries . Of course, if you don't want to fetch all hundreds of thousands of contacts, the query APIs support pagination with limit and offset functions! Cancellations are also supported! To cancel a query amid execution, . find { returnTrueIfQueryShouldBeCancelled () } The find function optionally takes in a function that, if it returns true, will cancel query processing as soon as possible. The function is called numerous times during query processing to check if processing should stop or continue. This gives you the option to cancel the query. This is useful when used in multi-threaded environments. One scenario where this would be frequently used is when performing queries as the user types a search text. You are able to cancel the current query when the user enters new text. For example, to automatically cancel the query inside a Kotlin coroutine when the coroutine is cancelled, launch { withContext ( coroutineContext ) { val contacts = query . find { ! isActive } } // Or, using the coroutine extensions in the async module... val contacts = query . findWithContext () } All core APIs are framework-agnostic and works well with Java and Kotlin \u00b6 The API does not and will not force you to use any frameworks (e.g. RxJava or Coroutines/Flow)! All core functions of the API live in the core module, which you can import to your project all by itself. Don't believe me? Take a look at the dependencies in the core/build.gradle :D So, feel free to use the core API however you want with whatever libraries or frameworks you want, such as Reactive, Coroutines/Flow, AsyncTask (hope not), WorkManager, and whatever permissions handling APIs you want to use. All other modules in this library are optional and are just there for your convenience or for reference. I also made sure that all core functions and entities are interoperable with Java. So, if you were wondering why I\u2019m using a semi-builder pattern instead of using named arguments with default values, that is why. I\u2019ve also made some other intentional decisions about API design to ensure the best possible experience for both Kotlin and Java consumers without sacrificing Kotlin language standards. It is Kotlin-first, Java-second (with love and care). \u26a0\ufe0f Modules other than the core module are not guaranteed to be compatible with Java. Requirements \u00b6 Min SDK 19+ Proguard \u00b6 If you use Proguard and the async and/or permissions modules, then you may need to add rules for Coroutines .

Fetch 10,000 contacts as fast as 99 milliseconds (varies per device)! \u2139\ufe0f For more info, read Optimizing queries . Of course, if you don't want to fetch all hundreds of thousands of contacts, the query APIs support pagination with limit and offset functions! Cancellations are also supported! To cancel a query amid execution, . find { returnTrueIfQueryShouldBeCancelled () } The find function optionally takes in a function that, if it returns true, will cancel query processing as soon as possible. The function is called numerous times during query processing to check if processing should stop or continue. This gives you the option to cancel the query. This is useful when used in multi-threaded environments. One scenario where this would be frequently used is when performing queries as the user types a search text. You are able to cancel the current query when the user enters new text. For example, to automatically cancel the query inside a Kotlin coroutine when the coroutine is cancelled, launch { withContext ( coroutineContext ) { val contacts = query . find { ! isActive } } // Or, using the coroutine extensions in the async module... val contacts = query . findWithContext () }","title":"All APIs in the library are optimized!"},{"location":"#all-core-apis-are-framework-agnostic-and-works-well-with-java-and-kotlin","text":"The API does not and will not force you to use any frameworks (e.g. RxJava or Coroutines/Flow)! All core functions of the API live in the core module, which you can import to your project all by itself. Don't believe me? Take a look at the dependencies in the core/build.gradle :D So, feel free to use the core API however you want with whatever libraries or frameworks you want, such as Reactive, Coroutines/Flow, AsyncTask (hope not), WorkManager, and whatever permissions handling APIs you want to use. All other modules in this library are optional and are just there for your convenience or for reference. I also made sure that all core functions and entities are interoperable with Java. So, if you were wondering why I\u2019m using a semi-builder pattern instead of using named arguments with default values, that is why. I\u2019ve also made some other intentional decisions about API design to ensure the best possible experience for both Kotlin and Java consumers without sacrificing Kotlin language standards. It is Kotlin-first, Java-second (with love and care). \u26a0\ufe0f Modules other than the core module are not guaranteed to be compatible with Java.","title":"All core APIs are framework-agnostic and works well with Java and Kotlin"},{"location":"#requirements","text":"Min SDK 19+","title":"Requirements"},{"location":"#proguard","text":"If you use Proguard and the async and/or permissions modules, then you may need to add rules for Coroutines .","title":"Proguard"},{"location":"#license","text":"Copyright 2023 Contacts Contributors Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

If you run into any build issues, open up Android Studio preferences and make sure the following is set correctly... Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Gradle Use Gradle from: 'gradlew-wrapper.properties' file Gradle JDK: Embedded JDK version 17.x.x Language & Frameworks -> Kotlin Current Kotlin plugin version: 222-1.8.20-release-AS3739.54 Restart Android Studio, clean, build, and invalidate caches & restart. Guidelines \u00b6 Simple is better. Over-engineering is not welcome here. Don't over complicate function implementations unnecessarily, especially the public API. Less is more. If you have not noticed yet, the dependency list of this project is almost non-existent. The core module only depends on Kotlin's standard library. Not even the support annotations are included (though this is questionable and may change quickly). All modules only have dependencies on essentials. Nice-to-haves are excluded. Contacts have been here since API 1. In that spirit, we should not need to import tons of unnecessary dependencies to deliver the most basic Android API. Java compatibility is a must. Java is not dead even in Android, though it may seem like it. There are still probably a lot of people that have not migrated over to Kotlin. This is especially true for larger organizations with large code bases and unable to afford migrating to Kotlin. The API must be usable in Java, with exceptions to Kotlin-specific modules (e.g. async, permissions). Be patient. Early on, I (Vandolf) will be the only one to approve incoming code. It may take a few days for me to review code and decline/approve. I have a full time job after all =) As time passes, I'm hoping to give the power of approvals to others in the community. Uphold the spirit of Contacts, Reborn! Don't deviate from the existing API design. New code should follow existing API design to promote uniformity. It'll be easier to maintain and cross-pollinate.","title":"Contributing"},{"location":"contributing/#contributing","text":"There are only a few loose guidelines to follow.

If you have not noticed yet, the dependency list of this project is almost non-existent. The core module only depends on Kotlin's standard library. Not even the support annotations are included (though this is questionable and may change quickly). All modules only have dependencies on essentials. Nice-to-haves are excluded. Contacts have been here since API 1. In that spirit, we should not need to import tons of unnecessary dependencies to deliver the most basic Android API. Java compatibility is a must. Java is not dead even in Android, though it may seem like it. There are still probably a lot of people that have not migrated over to Kotlin. This is especially true for larger organizations with large code bases and unable to afford migrating to Kotlin. The API must be usable in Java, with exceptions to Kotlin-specific modules (e.g. async, permissions). Be patient. Early on, I (Vandolf) will be the only one to approve incoming code. It may take a few days for me to review code and decline/approve. I have a full time job after all =) As time passes, I'm hoping to give the power of approvals to others in the community.

It serves as a memory of all the quirks and gotcha's of things like Android's ContactsContract . This is only meant to be read by contributors of this library, not consumers! Contacts Provider / ContactsContract \u00b6 It is important to know about the ins and outs of Android's Contacts Provider. After all, this API is just a wrapper around it. It is important to get familiar with the official documentation of the Contact's Provider . Here is a summary; There are 3 main database tables used in dealing with contacts; Contacts RawContacts Data \u2139\ufe0f There are more but that is covered later. All of these tables and their fields are enumerated and documented in android.provider.ContactsContract . Each table serves a different purpose; Contacts Rows representing different people. RawContacts Rows that link Contacts rows to specific Accounts. Data Rows containing data (e.g. name, email) for a RawContacts row. These tables contain the following (notable) information (columns); Contacts _ID DISPLAY_NAME_PRIMARY RawContacts _ID : the Contacts._ID ACCOUNT_NAME : the Account.name ACCOUNT_TYPE the Account.type Data RAW_CONTACT_ID : the RawContacts._ID CONTACT_ID : the Contacts._ID DATA_1 to DATA_15 : contains a piece of contact data (e.g. first and last name, email address and type) determined by the MIMETYPE MIMETYPE : the type of data that this row's DATA_X columns contain (e.g. name and email data) The tables are connected the following way; RawContacts contains a reference to the Contacts row Id. Data contains a reference to the RawContacts row Id and Contacts row Id. Contacts; Display Name \u00b6 The Contacts.DISPLAY_NAME name may be different than the Data StructuredName display name! If a structured name in the Data table is not provided, then other kinds of data will be used as the Contacts row display name. For example, if an email is provided but no structured name then the display name will be the email. When a structured name is inserted, the Contacts Provider automatically updates the Contacts row display name. \u2139\ufe0f In the case of StructuredName , the Contacts.DISPLAY_NAME is made up of the prefix, given, middle, family name, and suffix and not the unstructured display name. If no data rows suitable to be a display name are available, then the Contacts row display name will be null. Data suitable to be a Contacts row display name are enumerated in DisplayNameSources ; email nickname organization phone number structured name Data not suitable to be display names are; address event group im note relation sip website The kind of data used as the display for the Contact is set in ContactNameColumns.DISPLAY_NAME_SOURCE . A note about StructuredName There may be a scenario where the unstructured StructuredName.DISPLAY_NAME does not match the structured components. Such scenarios are possible but is considered incorrect. For example, it is possible to programmatically set the display name to \"Ice Cold\" but set the given and family name to \"Hot Fire\". The Contacts.DISPLAY_NAME is made up of the prefix, given, middle, family name, and suffix (\"Hot Fire\") and not the unstructured display name. The Contacts Provider's general matching algorithm does not include the Contacts.DISPLAY_NAME . However, the StructuredName.DISPLAY_NAME is included in the matching process but not the rest of the structured components (e.g. given and family name). The AOSP Contacts app displays the Contacts.DISPLAY_NAME . So, here comes the unusual scenario that looks like a bug. The general matching algorithm will match the text \"Ice\" or \"Cold\" but not \"Hot\" or \"Fire\". The end result is that searching for the Contact \"Ice Cold\" will show a Contact called \"Hot Fire\"! Contact Display Name and Default Name Rows \u00b6 If available, the \"default\" (isPrimary and isSuperPrimary set to 1) name row for a Contact is automatically set as the Contact display name by the Contacts Provider. Otherwise, the Contacts Provider chooses from any of the other suitable data from the aggregate Contact. \u2139\ufe0f The ContactsColumns.NAME_RAW_CONTACT_ID is automatically updated by the Contacts Provider along with the display name. The default status of other sources (e.g. email) does not affect the Contact display name. The AOSP Contacts app also sets the most recently updated name as the default at every update. This results in the Contact display name changing to the most recently updated name from one of the associated RawContacts. The \"most recently updated name\" is the name field that was last updated by the user when editing in the Contacts app, which is irrelevant to its value. It does not matter if the user deleted the last character of the name, added the same character back, and then saved. It still counts as the most recently updated. All of the above only applies to API 21 and above. Display name resolution is different for APIs below 21 (pre-Lollipop)! The ContactsColumns.NAME_RAW_CONTACT_ID was added in API 21. It changed the way display names are resolved for Contacts with more than one constituent RawContacts, which is what has been described so far. Before this change (APIs 20 and below), the AOSP Contacts app is still able to set the Contact display name somehow. I'm not sure how. If someone figures it out, please let me know. I tried updating the Contact DISPLAY_NAME directly but it does not work. Setting a name row as default also does not affect the Contact DISPLAY_NAME . Contacts; ID vs LOOKUP_KEY \u00b6 The Contacts._ID is the unique identifier for the row in the Contacts table. The Contacts.LOOKUP_KEY is the unique identifier for an aggregate Contact (a person). The _ID may change due to aggregation and sync. The same goes for the LOOKUP_KEY but unlike the ID it may still be used to find the aggregate contact. Unlike the Contact ID, the lookup key is the same across devices (for contacts that are associated with an Account and are synced). \u2139\ufe0f I did the following investigation with a much larger data set. I simplified it here for brevity. Let's take a look at the following Contacts and RawContacts table rows, #### Contacts table Contact id: 55, lookupKey: 0r55-2E4644502A2E50563A503840462E2A404C2A562E4644502A2E50, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Local RawContact Contact id: 56, lookupKey: 2059i6f5de8460f7f227e, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Synced RawContact #### RawContacts table RawContact id: 55, contactId: 55, sourceId: null, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Local RawContact RawContact id: 56, contactId: 56, sourceId: 6f5de8460f7f227e, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Synced RawContact There are two Contacts each having one RawContact. Notice that the lookup keys are a bit different. Contact With Local RawContact: 0r55-2E4644502A2E50563A503840462E2A404C2A562E4644502A2E50 Contact With Synced RawContact: 2059i6f5de8460f7f227e The Contact with synced RawContact uses the RawContact's SOURCE_ID as part of its lookup key. The Contact with unsynced, device-only, local RawContact has a much longer (or shorter e.g. 0r62-2A2C2E) lookup key and starts with \"0r -\" and all characters after it are in uppercase. The other thing to notice is that the \"55\" in \"0r55-\" seems to be the same as the RawContact ID (I did a bit more experiments than what is written in these notes to confirm that it is indeed the RawContact ID and not the Contact ID). We probably don't need to worry about these details though the Contacts Provider probably uses these things internally. We also should not rely on it. However, it may be safe to assume that the Contact lookup key is a reference to a RawContact (or reference to more than one constituent RawContact when multiple RawContacts are linked). Again, an internal Contacts Provider detail we should not rely on BUT is probably relevant when implementing sync adapters. When we link the two, we get... Contact id: 55, lookupKey: 0r55-2E4644502A2E50563A503840462E2A404C2A562E4644502A2E50.2059i6f5de8460f7f227e, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Synced RawContact #### RawContacts table RawContact id: 55, contactId: 55, sorceId: null, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Local RawContact RawContact id: 56, contactId: 55, sourceId: 6f5de8460f7f227e, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Synced RawContact Notice, Contact with ID 56 has been deleted. Contact with ID 55 still exist with the lookup keys of both Contact 55 and 56 combined separated by a \".\" . This holds true in cases where two or more local-only or non-local-only RawContacts are linked. RawContacts remain unchanged except reference to Contact 56 has been replaced with 55. The primary display name of Contact 55 came from RawContact 55 prior to the link and now comes from RawContact 56 after the link. This primary name resolution is probably irrelevant so pay no attention to it. The most important part to notice is that the lookup keys get combined. The lookup uri is required to build a Contacts.CONTENT_LOOKUP_URI ... /** * A content:// style URI for this table that should be used to create * shortcuts or otherwise create long-term links to contacts. This URI * should always be followed by a \"/\" and the contact's {@link #LOOKUP_KEY}. * It can optionally also have a \"/\" and last known contact ID appended after * that. This \"complete\" format is an important optimization and is highly recommended. * <p> * As long as the contact's row ID remains the same, this URI is * equivalent to {@link #CONTENT_URI}. If the contact's row ID changes * as a result of a sync or aggregation, this URI will look up the * contact using indirect information (sync IDs or constituent raw * contacts). * <p> * Lookup key should be appended unencoded - it is stored in the encoded * form, ready for use in a URI. */ public static final Uri CONTENT_LOOKUP_URI = Uri . withAppendedPath ( CONTENT_URI , \"lookup\" ); /** * Build a {@link #CONTENT_LOOKUP_URI} lookup {@link Uri} using the * given {@link ContactsContract.Contacts#_ID} and {@link #LOOKUP_KEY}. * <p> * Returns null if unable to construct a valid lookup URI from the * provided parameters. */ public static Uri getLookupUri ( long contactId , String lookupKey ) { if ( TextUtils . isEmpty ( lookupKey )) { return null ; } return ContentUris . withAppendedId ( Uri . withAppendedPath ( Contacts . CONTENT_LOOKUP_URI , lookupKey ), contactId ); } From the lookup uri, we can lookup the Contact row... public static Uri lookupContact ( ContentResolver resolver , Uri lookupUri ) { ... } Or simply get the Contact ID... // code inside `public static Uri lookupContact` resolver . query ( lookupUri , new String [] { Contacts . _ID }, null , null , null ) However, given that the lookup key of the deleted Contact 56 still lives on, it is possible to get the linked Contact 55 using the lookup key of Contact 56 using our standard query APIs! . where { Contact . LookupKey contains lookupKey } The above is correct as long as these assumptions hold true; the lookup key is unique there is no lookup key that can contain a shorter lookup key the Contact ID fails this test because a smaller number is contained in a larger number synced contacts have shorter lookup keys than local contacts. However, local contacts' lookup keys are capitalized whereas synced contact are not. Also, there seems to be other differences in pattern between long and short lookup keys. It should be safe to make this assumption. Until the community finds that this assumption is flawed, we'll assume that it is true! For now, we can avoid having to create another API or extensions just for using lookup keys . When we unlink , we get... #### Contacts table Contact id: 55, lookupKey: 2059i6f5de8460f7f227e, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Synced RawContact Contact id: 58, lookupKey: 0r55-2E4644502A2E50563A503840462E2A404C2A562E4644502A2E50, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Local RawContact #### RawContacts table RawContact id: 55, contactId: 58, sourceId: null, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Local RawContact RawContact id: 56, contactId: 55, sourceId: 6f5de8460f7f227e, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Synced RawContact Notice, A new Contact row with ID of 58 is created. The lookup keys are separated and distributed between Contact 55 and 58. RawContact 55 Contact reference has been set to Contact 58. Let's compare the Contact-RawContact relationship before and after linking and then unlinking. Contact ID Lookup Key RawContact.Contact ID Before 55, 56 0r55-2E4644502A2E50563A503840462E2A404C2A562E4644502A2E50, 2059i6f5de8460f7f227e 55, 56 After 55, 58 2059i6f5de8460f7f227e, 0r55-2E4644502A2E50563A503840462E2A404C2A562E4644502A2E50 58, 55 Notice, Contact ID 55 swapped lookup keys with the former Contact 56 (now 58). RawContact ID 55 swapped Contact reference with RawContact 56. The Contact IDs and lookup keys got shuffled BUT the Contact-RawContact relationship remains the same if using the lookup keys as point of reference! Here is another way to look at the table, using the lookup key as the constant... Lookup Key Before After 0r55-2E4644502A2E50563A503840462E2A404C2A562E4644502A2E50 Contact 55, RawContact 55 Contact 58, RawContact 55 2059i6f5de8460f7f227e Contact 56, RawContact 56 Contact 55, RawContact 56 Notice that the indirect relationship between the lookup key and RawContacts remains the same before and after the link-unlink even though the Contact IDs changed. \u2139\ufe0f As mentioned earlier in this section, the \"55\" in \"0r55-\" seems to be referencing the RawContact ID. In other words, since local RawContacts are not synced or tracked in a remote database where Contacts -> RawContacts mappings exist, the Contacts Provider most likely uses this \"0r -\" pattern to make the connection. This is not really relevant for us as we are not relying on this mechanism. I'm just pointing out my observations, which could be incorrect. This means that... If users of this library saved a reference Contact ID 55, then a link-unlink (or sync adapter functions) occur. Getting Contact by ID 55 will result in the RawContact-Data of the former Contact 56 to be returned. This is a bug! Same goes if users saved a reference to Contact ID 56. If users of this library saved a reference to the lookup keys, then a link-unlink (or sync adapter functions) occur. Getting Contact by lookup key will result in the correct RawContact-Data to be returned. So when to use Contact ID vs lookup key? Lookup key: for a reference to a Contact that needs to be loaded after some period of time. Saving/restoring activity/fragment instance state. Saving to an external database, preferences, or files. Creating shortcuts. ID: for everything else. Performing read/write operations in the same function call or session in your app. Performing read/write operations that require ID (e.g. Contact photo and options). Another thing to check is what happens when associating a local RawContact to an Account (move from device to Account) and vice versa. Is the lookup key of the Contact affected? After associating the local RawContact to an Account... #### Contacts table Contact id: 58, lookupKey: 2059i4abd4a8f8ff89642 #### RawContacts table RawContact id: 55, contactId: 58, sourceId: 2059i4abd4a8f8ff89642 The lookup key changed (since the RawContact's source ID has been assigned the value that came from the sync adapter) but the Contact ID remained the same! In this case, loading a reference to the previously local Contact will fail! I verified that this is indeed the behavior of the AOSP (AOSP) Contacts app. Moving the RawContact from device to Google using Google Contacts app while having Contact details activity opened in the AOSP Contacts app will result in \"error Contact does not exist\" message in the AOSP Contacts app! \u2139\ufe0f The RawContact and its Data also remained the same in this case. Removing the account from it results in... #### Contacts table Contact id: 59, lookupKey: 0r58-2E4644502A2E50563A503840462E2A404C2A562E4644502A2E50 #### RawContacts table RawContact id: 58, contactId: 59, sourceId: null The Contact and RawContacts row have been deleted and new rows have been created to replace them! I also verified that the Data rows have also been deleted and new rows have been created to replace them! This stuff is not really relevant for lookup key but still good to know for implementing moving between accounts in the future. RawContacts; Accounts + Contacts \u00b6 The RawContacts table associates a person to an android.accounts.Account that it belongs to. Each new RawContacts row created results in; a new row in the Contacts table (unless the RawContact is associated to another existing Contact) a new row in the RawContacts with account name and type set to null 0 or more rows in the Data table with a reference to the new Contacts and RawContacts Ids \u2139\ufe0f It is possible to create RawContacts without any rows in the Data table. See the Data required section for more details. For example, creating 4 new contacts using the AOSP Android Contacts app results in; Contact id: 4, displayName: First Local Contact Contact id: 5, displayName: Second Local Contact Contact id: 6, displayName: Third Local Contact Contact id: 7, displayName: Third Local Contact RawContact id: 4, accountName: null, accountType: null RawContact id: 5, accountName: null, accountType: null RawContact id: 6, accountName: null, accountType: null RawContact id: 7, accountName: null, accountType: null Data id: 15, rawContactId: 4, contactId: 4, data: First Local Contact Data id: 16, rawContactId: 5, contactId: 5, data: Second Local Contact Data id: 17, rawContactId: 6, contactId: 6, data: Third Local Contact Data id: 18, rawContactId: 7, contactId: 7, data: Third Local Contact Local Contacts / RawContacts RawContacts inserted without an associated account are considered local or device-only raw contacts, which are not synced. The AOSP Contacts app hides the following UI fields when inserting or updating local raw contacts; Event Relation Group memberships However, the Google Contacts app does not hide any of the above for local raw contacts. Actually, the Contacts Provider does not set any account restrictions with the above data kinds. Lollipop (API 22) and below When an Account is added, from a state where no accounts have yet been added to the system, the Contacts Provider automatically sets all of the null accountName and accountType in the RawContacts table to that Account's name and type; RawContact id: 4, accountName: vestrel00@gmail.com, accountType: com.google RawContact id: 5, accountName: vestrel00@gmail.com, accountType: com.google RawContact id: 6, accountName: vestrel00@gmail.com, accountType: com.google RawContact id: 7, accountName: vestrel00@gmail.com, accountType: com.google RawContacts inserted without an associated account will automatically get assigned to an account if there are any available. This may take a few seconds, whenever the Contacts Provider decides to do it. Dissociating RawContacts from Accounts will result in the Contacts Provider associating those back to an Account. Marshmallow (API 23) and above The Contacts Provider no longer associates local contacts to an account when an account is or becomes available. Local contacts remain local. Account removal Removing the Account will remove all of the associated rows in the local RawContact, Data, and Groups tables. This includes user Profile data in those tables. SyncColumns modifications This library supports modifying the SyncColumns.ACCOUNT_NAME and SyncColumns.ACCOUNT_TYPE of the RawContacts table in some cases only. In some cases does not work as intended and produces unwanted side-effects. It probably has something to do with syncing with remote servers and local Account / sync data not matching up similar to errors on network requests if the system time does not match network time. The motivation behind changing the Account columns of the RawContacts table rows is that it would allow users to; Associate local RawContacts (those that are not associated with an Account) to an Account, allowing syncing between devices. Dissociate RawContacts from their Account such that they remain local to the device and not synced between devices. Transfer RawContacts from one Account to another. When modifying the SyncColumns directly, the first works as intended. The second works with some unwanted side-effects. The third does not work at all and produces unwanted side-effects. These are the behaviors that I have found; Associating local RawContact A to Account X. Works as intended. RawContact A is now associated with Account X and is synced across devices. Dissociating RawContact A (setting the SyncColumns' Account name and type to null) from Account X. Partially works with some unwanted-side effects. Dissociates RawContact A from the device but not other devices. RawContact A is no longer visible in the AOSP Contacts app UNLESS it retains the group membership to at least the default group from an Account. At this point, RawContact A is a local contact. Changes to this local RawContact A will not be synced across devices. If RawContact A is updated in another device and synced up to the server, then a syncing side-effect occurs because the RawContact A in the device is different from the RawContact A in the server. This causes the Contacts Provider to create another RawContact, resulting in a \"duplicate\". The two RawContact As may get aggregated to the same Contact depending on how similar they are. If local RawContact A is re-associated back to Account X, it will still no longer be synced. Associating RawContact A from original Account X to Account Y. Does not work and have bad side-effects. No change in other devices. For Lollipop (API 22) and below, RawContact A is no longer visible in the AOSP Contacts app and syncing Account Y in system settings fails. For Marshmallow (API 23) and above, RawContact A is no longer visible in the AOSP Contacts app. RawContact A is automatically deleted locally at some point by the Contacts Provider. Syncing Account Y in system settings succeeds. Given that associating originally local RawContacts to an Account is the only thing that actually works, it is the only function that will be exposed to consumers. If consumers want to transfer RawContacts from one Account to another, they can create a copy of a RawContact associated with the desired Account and then delete the original RawContact. Same idea can be used to transform an Account-associated RawContact to a local RawContact. Perhaps we can implement some functions in this library that does these things? We won't for now because the AOSP Contacts app does not support these functions anyways. It can always be implemented later if the community really wants. Here are some other things to note. The Contacts Provider automatically creates a group membership to the default group (if exist) of the target Account when the account changes. The Contacts Provider DOES NOT delete existing group memberships when the account changes. UPDATE: My hunch for insert copies then deleting non-null account-associated RawContacts turns to perform an \"account move operation\" turned out to be correct (case 2 and 3). This is what apps like the Google Contacts app does. Actually, Google Contacts app takes it even further by performing insert-delete operation regardless of whether the RawContact is associated to an account or not (cases 1, 2, 3). It does not modify the SyncColumns.ACCOUNT_NAME and SyncColumns.ACCOUNT_TYPE even though case 1 seems to be supported (for now). We should follow what Google Contacts is doing. https://github.com/vestrel00/contacts-android/issues/168 RawContacts; Deletion \u00b6 Deleting a contact's Contacts row, RawContacts row(s), and associated Data row(s) are best explained in the documentation in ContactsContract.RawContacts ; When a raw contact is deleted, all of its Data rows as well as StatusUpdates, AggregationExceptions, PhoneLookup rows are deleted automatically. When all raw contacts associated with a Contacts row are deleted, the Contacts row itself is also deleted automatically. The invocation of resolver.delete(...), does not immediately delete a raw contacts row. Instead, it sets the ContactsContract.RawContactsColumns.DELETED flag on the raw contact and removes the raw contact from its aggregate contact. The sync adapter then deletes the raw contact from the server and finalizes phone-side deletion by calling resolver.delete(...) again and passing the ContactsContract#CALLER_IS_SYNCADAPTER query parameter. Some sync adapters are read-only, meaning that they only sync server-side changes to the phone, but not the reverse. If one of those raw contacts is marked for deletion, it will remain on the phone. However it will be effectively invisible, because it will not be part of any aggregate contact. TLDR To delete a contacts and all associated rows, simply delete all RawContact rows with the desired Contacts id. Deletion of the Contacts row and associated Data row(s) will be done automatically by the Contacts Provider. Note that deleting a RawContacts row may not immediately delete the RawContacts row. In this case, it is marked as deleted and its reference to a contact id is nulled. The Contact may still exist if it still has at least one constituent RawContact that is not marked for deletion. \u2139\ufe0f A RawContact is marked for deletion as specified by RawContactsColumns.DELETED . Typically, deleting RawContacts immediately removes the row from the RawContacts table. However, RawContacts row remains and is simply marked for deletion UNTIL the sync adapters syncs the changes. One of the reasons syncs do not occur is when the system sync settings are turned off for the Account or there is no network connection. Such RawContacts should not be included in query results for Contacts. The AOSP and Google Contacts app also does not show them. Note that local RawContacts rows (not associated with an Account) are deleted immediately as no sync needs to occur. Multiple RawContacts Per Contact \u00b6 Each row in the Contacts table may be associated with more than one row in the RawContacts table. The Contacts Provider may consolidate multiple contacts belonging to different accounts and combine them into a single entry in the Contacts table whilst maintaining the separate entries in the RawContacts table. A more likely scenario that causes multiple RawContacts per Contact is when two or more Contacts are \"linked\" (or \"merged\" for API 23 and below, or \"joined\" for API 22 and below). Behavior of linking/merging/joining contacts (AggregationExceptions) \u00b6 The AOSP Contacts app terminology has changed over time; API 22 and below; join / separate API 23; merge / unmerge API 24 and above; link / unlink However, the internals have not changed; KEEP_TOGETHER / KEEP_SEPARATE . These operations are supported by the ContactsContract.AggregationExceptions . For example, given the following tables, ### Contacts table Contact id: 32, displayName: X, starred: 0, timesContacted: 1, lastTimeContacted: 1573071785456, customRingtone: content://media/internal/audio/media/109, sendToVoicemail: 0 Contact id: 33, displayName: Y, starred: 1, timesContacted: 2, lastTimeContacted: 1573071750624, customRingtone: content://media/internal/audio/media/115, sendToVoicemail: 1 ### RawContacts table RawContact id: 30, contactId: 32, displayName: X, accountName: x@x.com, accountType: com.google, starred: 0, timesContacted: 1, lastTimeContacted: 1573071785456, customRingtone: content://media/internal/audio/media/109, sendToVoicemail: 0 RawContact id: 31, contactId: 33, displayName: Y, accountName: y@y.com, accountType: com.google, starred: 1, timesContacted: 2, lastTimeContacted: 1573071750624, customRingtone: content://media/internal/audio/media/115, sendToVoicemail: 1 ### Data table Data id: 57, rawContactId: 30, contactId: 32, mimeType: vnd.android.cursor.item/group_membership, data1: 18 Data id: 58, rawContactId: 30, contactId: 32, mimeType: vnd.android.cursor.item/name, data1: X, isPrimary: 1, isSuperPrimary: 1 Data id: 59, rawContactId: 30, contactId: 32, mimeType: vnd.android.cursor.item/email_v2, data1: x@x.com Data id: 60, rawContactId: 30, contactId: 32, mimeType: vnd.android.cursor.item/email_v2, data1: xx@x.com, isPrimary: 1, isSuperPrimary: 1 Data id: 63, rawContactId: 31, contactId: 33, mimeType: vnd.android.cursor.item/group_membership, data1: 6 Data id: 64, rawContactId: 31, contactId: 33, mimeType: vnd.android.cursor.item/name, data1: Y, isPrimary: 1, isSuperPrimary: 1 Data id: 65, rawContactId: 31, contactId: 33, mimeType: vnd.android.cursor.item/email_v2, data1: y@y.com Data id: 66, rawContactId: 31, contactId: 33, mimeType: vnd.android.cursor.item/email_v2, data1: yy@y.com, isPrimary: 1, isSuperPrimary: 1 When Contact X links/merges/joins Contact Y , the tables becomes; ### Contacts table Contact id: 32, displayName: X, starred: 1, timesContacted: 2, lastTimeContacted: 1573071785456, customRingtone: content://media/internal/audio/media/109, sendToVoicemail: 0 ### RawContacts table RawContact id: 30, contactId: 32, displayName: X, accountName: x@x.com, accountType: com.google, starred: 0, timesContacted: 1, lastTimeContacted: 1573071785456, customRingtone: content://media/internal/audio/media/109, sendToVoicemail: 0 RawContact id: 31, contactId: 32, displayName: Y, accountName: y@y.com, accountType: com.google, starred: 1, timesContacted: 2, lastTimeContacted: 1573071750624, customRingtone: content://media/internal/audio/media/115, sendToVoicemail: 1 ### Data table Data id: 57, rawContactId: 30, contactId: 32, mimeType: vnd.android.cursor.item/group_membership, data1: 18 Data id: 58, rawContactId: 30, contactId: 32, mimeType: vnd.android.cursor.item/name, data1: X, isPrimary: 1, isSuperPrimary: 1 Data id: 59, rawContactId: 30, contactId: 32, mimeType: vnd.android.cursor.item/email_v2, data1: x@x.com Data id: 60, rawContactId: 30, contactId: 32, mimeType: vnd.android.cursor.item/email_v2, data1: xx@x.com, isPrimary: 1, isSuperPrimary: 0 Data id: 63, rawContactId: 31, contactId: 32, mimeType: vnd.android.cursor.item/group_membership, data1: 6 Data id: 64, rawContactId: 31, contactId: 32, mimeType: vnd.android.cursor.item/name, data1: Y, isPrimary: 1, isSuperPrimary: 0 Data id: 65, rawContactId: 31, contactId: 32, mimeType: vnd.android.cursor.item/email_v2, data1: y@y.com Data id: 66, rawContactId: 31, contactId: 33, mimeType: vnd.android.cursor.item/email_v2, data1: yy@y.com, isPrimary: 1, isSuperPrimary: 0 What changed? Contact Y's row has been deleted and its column values have been merged into Contact X row. If the reverse occurred (Contact Y merged with Contact X), Contact Y's row would still be deleted. The difference is that Contact X's display name will be set to Contact Y's display name, which is done by the AOSP Contacts app manually by setting Contact Y's Data name row to be the \"default\" (isPrimary and isSuperPrimary both set to 1). \u2139\ufe0f The AggregationExceptions table records the linked RawContacts' IDs in ascending order regardless of the order used in RAW_CONTACT_ID1 and RAW_CONTACT_ID2 at the time of merging. The RawContacts and Data table remains the same except the joined contactId column values have now been changed to the id of Contact X. All Data rows' isSuperPrimary value has been set to 0 though the isPrimary columns remain the same. In other words, this clears any \"default\" set before the link. These are done automatically by the Contacts Provider during the link operation. What is not done automatically by the Contacts Provider is that the name row of former Contact X is set as the default. The AOSP Contacts app does this manually. The Contacts Providers automatically sets the Contact display name to whatever the default name row is for the Contact, if available. For more info on Contact display name resolution, read the Contact Display Name and Default Name Rows section. \u2139\ufe0f Display name resolution is different for APIs below 21 (pre-lollipop). The display name of the RawContacts remain the same. The Groups table remains unmodified. Options updates Changes to the options (starred, timesContacted, lastTimeContacted, customRingtone, and sendToVoicemail) of a RawContact may affect the options of the parent Contact. On the other hand, changes to the options of the parent Contact will be propagated to all child RawContact options. Photo updates A RawContact may have a full-sized photo saved as a file and a thumbnail version of that saved in the Data table in a photo mimetype row. A Contact's full-sized photo and thumbnail are simply references to the \"chosen\" RawContact's full-sized photo and thumbnail (though the URIs may differ). \u2139\ufe0f When removing the photo in the AOSP contacts app, the photo data row is not immediately deleted, though the PHOTO_FILE_ID is immediately set to null. This may result in the PHOTO_URI and PHOTO_THUMBNAIL_URI to still have a valid image uri even though the photo has been \"removed\". This library immediately deletes the photo data row, which seems to work perfectly. Data inserts In the AOSP Contacts app, Data inserted in combined (raw) contacts mode will be associated to the first RawContact in the list sorted by the RawContact ID. \u2139\ufe0f This may not be the same as the RawContact referenced by ContactsColumns.NAME_RAW_CONTACT_ID . UI changes? The AOSP Contacts App does not display the groups field when displaying / editing Contacts that have multiple RawContacts (linked/merged/joined) in combined mode. However, it does allow editing individual RawContact Data rows in which case the groups field is displayed and editable. In the AOSP Contacts app, the name attribute used comes from the name row with IS_SUPER_PRIMARY set to true. This and all other \"unique\" mimetypes (organization) and non-unique mimetypes (email) per RawContact are shown only if they are not blank. Showing multiple RawContact's data in the same edit screen (combined mode) In older version of the AOSP, Android Open Source Project (AOSP) Contacts app, data from multiple RawContacts was being shown in the same edit screen. This caused a lot of confusion about which data belonged to which RawContact. Newer versions of AOSP Contacts only allow editing one RawContact at a time to avoid confusion. Though, several RawContacts' data are still shown (not-editable) in the same screen. AggregationExceptions table \u00b6 Given the following Contacts and their RawContacts; Contact A RawContact 1 Contact B RawContact 2 Contact C RawContact 3 Contact D RawContact 4 Linking one by one in this order; Contact B link Contact A Contact C link Contact D Contact C link Contact B Results in the following AggregationExceptions rows respectively; Aggregation exception id: 430, type: 1, rawContactId1: 1, rawContactId2: 2 Aggregation exception id: 430, type: 1, rawContactId1: 1, rawContactId2: 2 Aggregation exception id: 432, type: 1, rawContactId1: 3, rawContactId2: 4 Aggregation exception id: 436, type: 1, rawContactId1: 1, rawContactId2: 2 Aggregation exception id: 439, type: 1, rawContactId1: 1, rawContactId2: 3 Aggregation exception id: 442, type: 1, rawContactId1: 1, rawContactId2: 4 Aggregation exception id: 440, type: 1, rawContactId1: 2, rawContactId2: 3 Aggregation exception id: 443, type: 1, rawContactId1: 2, rawContactId2: 4 Aggregation exception id: 444, type: 1, rawContactId1: 3, rawContactId2: 4 There is a pattern here. RawContact ids are sorted in ascending order and linked from least to greatest exhaustively but no double links (1-2 is the same as 2-1). RawContact 1 has a row with RawContact 2, 3, and 4. RawContact 2 has a row with RawContact 3 and 4. RawContact 3 has a row with RawContact 4. Linking all in one go; Contact C link Contact A, B, D Results in the same AggregationExceptions rows. Unlinking results in the same AggregationExceptions rows except the type is 2 (TYPE_KEEP_SEPARATE). Data Table \u00b6 The Data table uses generic column names (e.g. \"data1\", \"data2\", ...) using the column \"mimetype\" to distinguish the type of data in that generic column. For example, the column name of StructuredName.DISPLAY_NAME is the same as Email.ADDRESS , which is \"data1\". Each row in the Data table consists of a piece of RawContact data (e.g. a phone number), its \"mimetype\", and the associated RawContact and Contact id. A row does not contain all of the data for a contact. RawContacts may only have one row of certain mimetypes and may have multiple rows of other mimetypes. Here is the list. Unique mimetype per RawContact Name (StructuredName) Nickname Note Organization Photo SipAddress Non-unique mimetype per Raw Contact Address (StructuredPostal) Email Event GroupMembership Im Phone Relation Website Although some mimetypes are unique per RawContact, none of those mimetypes are unique per Contact because a Contact is an aggregate of one or more RawContacts! Data Primary and Super Primary Rows \u00b6 As per documentation, for a set of data rows with the same mimetype (e.g. a set of emails), there should only be one primary data row (e.g. email) per RawContact and one super primary data row per Contact. Furthermore, a data row that is super primary must also be primary. Unfortunately, the Contacts Provider does not do any data set validation for the Data columns IS_PRIMARY and IS_SUPER_PRIMARY . This means that it is possible to set more than one data row of the same mimetype as primary for the same RawContact and super primary for the same aggregate Contact. It is also possible to set a data row as super primary but not primary. Upholding the the contract is left to us... For example, given this relationship; Contact RawContact X Email A Email B RawContact Y Email C Email D When Emails A, B, C, and D are inserted with the RawContacts or after the RawContacts have been created, we get the following state; Email Primary Super Primary A 0 0 B 0 0 C 0 0 D 0 0 The state does not change when RawContact X is linked with RawContact Y. After setting Email A as the \"default\" email, it becomes primary and super primary; Email Primary Super Primary A 1 1 B 0 0 C 0 0 D 0 0 Then setting Email B as the default email, it becomes primary and super primary. Email A is no longer primary or super primary. Email Primary Super Primary A 0 0 B 1 1 C 0 0 D 0 0 Then setting Email C as the default email, it becomes primary and super primary. Email B is still primary because it belongs to a different RawContact than Email C. However, Email B is no longer the super primary as there can only be one per aggregate Contact. Email Primary Super Primary A 0 0 B 1 0 C 1 1 D 0 0 Then setting Email D as the default email, it becomes primary and super primary. Email C is no longer primary or super primary. Email Primary Super Primary A 0 0 B 1 0 C 0 0 D 1 1 Then clearing the default email D, removes its primary and super primary status. However, email B remains a primary but not a super primary. Email Primary Super Primary A 0 0 B 1 0 C 0 0 D 0 0 The above behavior is observed from the AOSP Contacts app. The \"super primary\" data of an aggregate Contact is referred to as the \"default\". \u2139\ufe0f At this point, the AOSP Contacts app still shows email B as the first email in the list even though it isn't the \"default\" (super primary) because it is still a primary. This adds a bit of confusion in my opinion, especially when more than 2, 3, or 4 RawContacts are linked. A \"fix\" would be to only order the list of emails using \"super primary\" instead of \"super primary\" and \"primary\". OR to remove the primary status of the data set of all linked RawContacts. One benefit of the AOSP Contacts implementation of this is that it retains the primary status when unlinking RawContacts. This library should follow what the AOSP Contacts app is doing in spirit of recreating the AOSP experience as closely as possible, even if it seems like a lesser experience. Data Table Joins \u00b6 All columns accessible via cursors returned from Data table queries are specified in DataColumnsWithJoins , which includes the DataColumns , ContactsColumns , and ContactOptionsColumns . In code, mentions of the \"Data table\" typically refers to the joined table. The DataColumns gives us access to all of the columns in the Data table. All other joined columns, including the ContactsColumns are appended to each row in the query. This means that the ContactsColumns ; DISPLAY_NAME , PHOTO_URI , and PHOTO_THUMBNAIL_URI are repeated for all Data rows belonging to the same Contact. The ContactOptionsColumns values joined with the Data table are the values of the Contact, not the RawContact that the Data row belongs to! The same applies to the \"display_name\". Data Updates \u00b6 A new row in the Data table is created for each new piece of data (e.g. email address) entered for the contact. Removing a piece of existing data results in the deletion of the row in the Data table if that row no longer contains any meaningful data (no meaningful non-null \"datax\" columns left). This is the behavior of the AOSP Android Contacts app. Therefore, querying for null fields is not possible. For example, there may be no Data rows that exist where the email address is null. Thus, a query to search for all contacts with null email address may return 0 contacts even if there are some contacts without email addresses. Data Required \u00b6 Creating blank RawContacts without email address (or other fields), results in no rows in the Data table for the email address, and all other fields. There are a few exceptions. The following Data rows are automatically created for all contacts, if not provided; Group membership, underlying value defaults to the account's default system group Name, underlying value defaults to null Nickname, underlying value defaults to null Note, underlying value defaults to null \u2139\ufe0f All of the above rows are only automatically created for RawContacts that are associated with an Account. If a valid account is provided, the default (auto add) system group membership row is automatically created immediately by the Contacts Provider at the time of contact insertion. The name, nickname, and note are automatically created at a later time. If a valid account is not provided, none of the above data rows are automatically created. Blank RawContacts The Contacts Providers allows for RawContacts that have no rows in the Data table (let's call them \"blanks\") to exist. The AOSP Contacts app does not allow insertion of new RawContacts without at least one data row. It also deletes blanks on update. Despite seemingly not allowing blanks, the AOSP Contacts app shows them. There are two scenarios where blanks may exist. Contact with RawContact(s) with no Data row(s). In this case, the Contact is blank as well as its RawContact(s). Contact that has RawContact with Data row(s) and a RawContact with no Data row. In this case, the Contact and the RawContact with Data row(s) are not blank but the RawContact with no Data row is blank. Data StructuredName \u00b6 The DISPLAY_NAME is the unstructured representation of the name. It is made up of structured components; PREFIX , GIVEN_NAME , MIDDLE_NAME , FAMILY_NAME , and SUFFIX . When updating or inserting a row; If the display name is null and there are non-null structured components provided (e.g. given and family name), the Contacts Provider will automatically set the display name by combining the structured components. If the display name is not null and all structured components are null, the Contacts Provider automatically (to the best of its ability) derive the values for all the structured components. If the display name and structured components are not null, the Contacts Provider does nothing automatically. Data StructuredPostal \u00b6 The FORMATTED_ADDRESS is the unstructured representation of the postal address. It is made up of structured components; STREET , POBOX , NEIGHBORHOOD , CITY , REGION , POSTCODE , and COUNTRY . When updating or inserting a row; If the formatted address is null and there are non-null structured components provided (e.g. street and city), the Contacts Provider will automatically set the formatted address by combining the structured components. If the formatted address is not null and all structured components are null, the Contacts Provider automatically sets the street value to the formatted address. If the formatted address and structured components are not null, the Contacts Provider does nothing automatically. Groups Table & Accounts \u00b6 Contacts are assigned to one or more groups via the GroupMembership . It typically looks like this; Group id: 1, systemId: Contacts, isReadOnly: 1, title: My Contacts, favorites: 0, autoAdd: 1, accountName: vestrel00@gmail.com, accountType: com.google Group id: 2, systemId: null, isReadOnly: 1, title: Starred in Android, favorites: 1, autoAdd: 0, accountName: vestrel00@gmail.com, accountType: com.google Group id: 3, systemId: Friends, isReadOnly: 1, title: Friends, favorites: 0, autoAdd: 0, accountName: vestrel00@gmail.com, accountType: com.google Group id: 4, systemId: Family, isReadOnly: 1, title: Family, favorites: 0, autoAdd: 0, accountName: vestrel00@gmail.com, accountType: com.google Group id: 5, systemId: Coworkers, isReadOnly: 1, title: Coworkers, favorites: 0, autoAdd: 0, accountName: vestrel00@gmail.com, accountType: com.google Group id: 6, systemId: null, isReadOnly: 0, title: Custom Group, favorites: 0, autoAdd: 0, accountName: vestrel00@gmail.com, accountType: com.google The actual groups are in a separate table; Groups. Each group is associated with an Account. The AOSP Contacts app does not allow for Groups to exist without an Account. However, other apps such as the Google Contacts app allows for Groups with a null account. The Contacts Provider also allows this. Therefore, we will allow Group without accounts in this library and let library users decide if they want to restrict groups to non-null accounts. Each account will have its own set of the above system groups. This means that there may be multiple groups with the same title belonging to different accounts. System ids are typically Contacts, Friends, Family, and Coworkers. These ids are typically the same across all copies of Android. Notes; - The Contacts system group is the default group in which all raw contacts of an account belongs to. Therefore, it is typically hidden when showing the list of groups in the UI. - The starred (favorites) group is not a system group as it has null system id. However, it behaves like one in that it is read only and it comes with most (if not all) copies of the AOSP app. Removing the Account will delete all of the associated rows in the Groups table. Groups, duplicate titles The Contacts Provider allows multiple groups with the same title (case-sensitive comparison) belonging to the same account to exist. In older versions of Android, the AOSP Contacts app allows the creation of new groups with existing titles. In newer versions, duplicate titles are not allowed. Therefore, this library does not allow for duplicate titles. \u2139\ufe0f In newer versions, the group with the duplicate title gets deleted either automatically by the Contacts Provider or when viewing groups in the AOSP Contacts app. It's not an immediate failure on insert or update. This could lead to bugs! Groups Table & GroupMemberships (Data Table) \u00b6 There may be multiple groups with the same title from different accounts. Therefore, the group membership should point to the group belonging to the same account as the raw contact. The AOSP Contacts app displays only the groups belonging to the selected account. Updating group memberships of existing raw contacts seem to be almost instant. All raw contacts must be a part of at least the default group (system id is \"Contacts\"). Raw contacts with no group membership will be asynchronously added to the Account's default group by the Contacts Provider. Membership to the default group should never be deleted! Starred in Android (Favorites) \u00b6 When the ContactOptionsColumns.STARRED column of a Contact in the Contacts table is set to true, the Contacts Provider automatically adds a group membership to the favorites group for all RawContacts linked to the Contact. Setting STARRED to false removes all group memberships to the favorites group. The STARRED is interdependent with group memberships to the favorites group. Adding a group membership to the favorites group results in STARRED being set to true. Removing the membership sets it to false. Raw contacts that are not associated with an account do not have any group memberships. Even though these raw contacts may not have a membership to the favorites group, they may still be \"starred\" (favorited) via the ContactOptionsColumns.STARRED column in the Contacts table, which is not dependent on the existence of a favorites group membership. Refresh RawContact instances after changing the starred value. Otherwise, performing an update on the RawContact with a stale set of group memberships may revert the star/unstar operation. For example, query returns a starred RawContact -> set starred to false -> update RawContact (still containing a group membership to the favorites group) -> starred will be set back to true. Group memberships & Local RawContacts \u00b6 Local RawContacts may have a group membership to the default system group of an Account without being associated with the Account... The AOSP Contacts app may not have an edit-RawContact option for newly inserted RawContacts that have no group membership to the default group when an Account is available. Though, edits can still be made in other ways. Instead, an option to \"Add to contacts\" is shown that adds a membership to the default group but does not associate the raw contact to the Account that owns the group. The edit UI does not show the group membership field. Weirdly, this only occurs when there is exactly only one Account. If there are no Accounts or there are two or more Accounts, then this does not occur. Also, this does not occur for a Contact with a RawContact that has a group membership AND a RawContact that has no group membership. Groups; Deletion \u00b6 Similar to deleting RawContacts, deleting a Groups row may not immediately delete the Groups row. In this case, it is marked as deleted. \u2139\ufe0f A Group is marked for deletion as specified by GroupsColumns.DELETED . Typically, deleting Groups immediately removes the row from the Groups table. However, Groups row remains and is simply marked for deletion UNTIL the sync adapters syncs the changes. One of the reasons syncs do not occur is when the system sync settings are turned off for the Account or there is no network connection. Such Groups should not be included in query results for Contacts. The AOSP and Google Contacts app also does not show them. Note that local Groups rows (not associated with an Account) are deleted immediately as no sync needs to occur. Groups; UI \u00b6 In newer Android versions of the AOSP Contacts app, \"groups\" are now being referred to as \"labels\". However, the underlying code still uses groups. Google is probably just trying to make it more user friendly by calling it label instead of group. User Profile \u00b6 There exist one (profile) Contacts row that identifies the user; ContactsColumns.IS_USER_PROFILE . There is at least one RawContacts row that is associated with the user profile; RawContactsColumns.RAW_CONTACT_IS_USER_PROFILE . Associated RawContacts may or may not be associated with an Account. The RawContacts row(s) may have rows in the Data table as usual. These profile table rows have special IDs that differ from regular rows. See ContactsContract.isProfileId . \u2139\ufe0f The Contacts Provider will throw an IllegalArgument exception when attempting to include ContactsColumns.IS_USER_PROFILE and RawContactsColumns.RAW_CONTACT_IS_USER_PROFILE columns in Data table queries. I have not yet tried including these columns in the Contacts or RawContacts table queries. The profile Contact row may not be merged / linked with other contacts and do not belong to any group (favorites / starred). Profile rows in the Contacts, RawContacts, and Data table are not visible via queries in the respective tables. They will not be in the resulting cursor. To get the profile Contacts table rows, query the Profile.CONTENT_URI . To get profile RawContacts table rows, query the Profile.CONTENT_RAW_CONTACTS_URI . To get the profile Data table rows, query the Profile.CONTENT_RAW_CONTACTS_URI appended with the RawContact id and RawContacts.Data.CONTENT_DIRECTORY . To insert a new profile RawContact, use Profile.CONTENT_RAW_CONTACTS_URI . It will automatically be associated with the profile Contact. If the profile Contact does not yet exist, it will be created automatically. To insert a new profile Data row, either; insert to the Profile.CONTENT_RAW_CONTACTS_URI appended with the RawContact id and RawContacts.Data.CONTENT_DIRECTORY insert to the Data table directly, referencing the RawContact id Same rules apply to all table rows. If all profile RawContacts table rows have been deleted, then associated Contacts and Data table rows will automatically be deleted. Profile aggregation The RawContacts of a (Contact) Profile are linked via the indexed rows; Profile.CONTENT_RAW_CONTACTS_URI . Therefore, the AggregationsExceptions table is not used here. Profile and users Note that as of Android 5 Lollipop, there may exist multiple users in a device. Each user has a separate list of accounts and contact data. This also means that each user has a separate (local) profile contact. Profile and Accounts According to the Profile documentation; \"... each account (including data set, if applicable) on the device may contribute a single raw contact representing the user's personal profile data from that source.\" In other words, one account can have one profile RawContact. Whether or not profile RawContacts associated to an Account can be carried over and synced across devices and users is up to the Contacts Provider / Sync provider for that Account. \u2139\ufe0f From my experience, profile RawContacts associated to an Account is not carried over / synced across devices or users. Despite the documentation of \"one profile RawContact per one Account\", the Contacts Provider allows for multiple RawContacts per Account, including multiple local RawContacts (no Account). Thus, we should let consumers exploit this but set defaults to be one-for-one. Creating / setting up the profile in the AOSP Contacts app results in the creation of a local RawContact (not associated with an Account) even if there are available Accounts. The Contacts Provider does not associate local contacts to an account when an account is or becomes available (regardless of API level). Removing the Account will delete all of the associated rows in the Contact, RawContact, Data, and Groups tables. This includes user Profile data in those tables. Profile permissions Profile permissions (READ_PROFILE and WRITE_PROFILE) have been removed since API 23. However, they are still required for API 22 and below. Reading and writing the profile is included in the Contacts permissions. There is no need to ask for profile permissions at runtime because prior to API 23, permissions in the AndroidManifest have to be accepted prior to installation. Syncing Data / Sync Adapters \u00b6 First, it\u2019s good to know the official documentation of sync adapters; https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/contacts-provider#SyncAdapters Now, let\u2019s ingest the official docs\u2026 Data belonging to a RawContact that is associated with a Google account will be available anywhere the Google account is used; in any Android or iOS device, a web browser, etc\u2026 Data is synced by Google\u2019s sync adapters to and from their remote servers. Syncing depends on the account sync settings, which can be configured in the AOSP system settings app and possibly through some remote configuration. This library does not provide any sync adapters. Instead, it relies on existing sync adapters to do the syncing. Sync adapters and syncing are really out of scope of this library. Syncing is its own thing that typically happens outside of an application UI. This library is focused on reading and writing AOSP and custom data to and from the local database. Syncing the local database to and from a remote service is a different story altogether =) Custom Data / MimeTypes \u00b6 First, it\u2019s good to know the official documentation of custom data rows; https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/contacts-provider#CustomData Now, let\u2019s ingest the official docs\u2026 Custom mimetypes do not belong to the AOSP Contacts Provider mimetype set (e.g. address, email, phone, etc). The Contacts Provider allows for the creation of new / custom mimetypes. This is especially useful for other apps (Google Contacts, Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, etc) that want to attach extra pieces of data to a particular RawContact. Custom data are NOT synced, including those that belong to RawContacts that are associated with an Account. Custom sync adapters are required to sync custom data. This library currently does NOT provide custom sync adapters to sync custom data! Custom data from other apps such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, etc may or may not be synced. It all depends on those applications and their custom sync adapters (if they have any) and sync settings. For insight on how aforementioned social media services may be syncing their data, read through the official documentation; https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/contacts-provider#SocialStream Unused ContactsContract Stuff \u00b6 We are currently not utilizing these things because I haven't found usages of them while using the AOSP Contacts app. They are probably working behind the scenes but until we find uses for these, let's leave it out because YAGNI . Settings . Contacts-specific settings for various Accounts (settings for an Account). Might be useful to add this for SHOULD_SYNC and UNGROUPED_VISIBLE . ContactsColumns.IN_VISIBLE_GROUP + Groups.GROUP_VISIBLE . Flag indicating if the contacts belonging to this group should be visible in any user interface. Java Support \u00b6 This library is intended to be Java-friendly. The policy is that we should attempt to write Java-friendly code that does not increase lines of code by much or add external dependencies to cater exclusively to Java users. Creating Entities & data class \u00b6 First, consumers are not allowed to create immutable entities. Those must come from the API itself to ensure data integrity. Whether or not we will change this in the future is debatable =) Consumers are able to set read-only and private or internal variables though because all Entity implementations are data classes. Data classes provide a copy function that allows for setting any property no matter their visibility and even if the constructor is private. As a matter of fact, setting the constructor of a data class as private gives this warning by Android Studio: \"Private data class constructor is exposed via the 'copy' method. There is currently no way to disable the copy function of data classes (that I know of). The only thing we can do is to provide documentation to consumers, insisting against the use of the copy method as it may lead to unwanted side effects when updating and deleting contacts. \u2139\ufe0f We could just use regular classes instead of data classes but entities should be data classes because it is what they are (know what I mean?!). Also, I'd hate to have to generate equals and hashcode functions for them, which will make the code harder to maintain. Though, we might do this anyways at some point if we want to make it possible for a mutable entity to equal an immutable entity. Time will tell =) FIXME? Hide / disable data class copy function if kotlin ever allows it. https://discuss.kotlinlang.org/t/data-class-copy-visibility-modifier/19746 Immutable vs Mutable Entities \u00b6 This library provides true immutability for immutable entities. Take a look at the current (simplified) hierarchy; sealed interface ContactEntity { val rawContacts : List < RawContactEntity > } data class Contact ( override val rawContacts : List < RawContact > ) : ContactEntity data class MutableContact ( override val rawContacts : List < MutableRawContact > ) : ContactEntity sealed interface RawContactEntity data class RawContact ( val addresses : List < Address > ) : RawContactEntity data class MutableRawContact ( val addresses : MutableList < MutableAddress > ) : RawContactEntity data class Address ( val formattedAddress : String? ) data class MutableAddress ( var formattedAddress : String? ) \u2139\ufe0f The use of sealed class is to prevent consumers from defining their own entities. This restriction may or may not change in the future. Notice that there is nothing mutable in the immutable Contact . Everything are val s and the data structures used (i.e. RawContact , Address , and List ) are all immutable. This provides consumers 100% confidence that immutable entities are not mutable. They will not change or mutate in any way. Once they are constructed, they will always remain the same. Why immutability is so important will not be covered in this dev notes because it would be too big (that's what she said) and there are blogs and books written about this. One of the most important advantages of immutability is that it is thread-safe. Immutable instances can be used in several different threads without the need for synchronization and worries about deadlocks. In other words, they are thread-safe and faster than the mutable version. The current structure also allows consumers to be able to distinguish between immutable and mutable entities exhaustively. E.G. fun doSomethingAndReturn ( contact : ContactEntity ) = when ( contact ) { is Contact -> {} is MutableContact -> {} } \u2139\ufe0f The mutable entities provided in this library are NOT thread-safe . Consumers will have to perform their own synchronizations if they want to use and mutate mutable entities in multi-threaded scenarios. The cost of the current immutability implementation \u00b6 The cost of implementing true immutability is more lines of code. Notice that the MutableContact does not inherit from Contact . The same goes for the other entities. This leads to having to write seemingly duplicate code when writing functions and extensions. // FIXME? Furthermore, equality between immutable and mutable entities are not yet implemented. This means that Contact(\"john\") == MutableContact(\"john\") will return false even though their underlying contents are the same. This can be fixed by overriding the equals and hashcode functions of all entities. However, that is a lot more code that I would like to avoid, which is why I'm using data class for all entities in the first place! This may change in the future if the community really wants to change it =) On a side note, the same cost is incurred by Kotlin's standard libs. For example, notice that AbstractMutableList does not inherit from and is completely separate from AbstractList . I'm sure stdlib devs also had to write seemingly duplicate code in implementations of the List interface. Avoiding the cost... Shortcuts and pitfalls. \u00b6 One thing that may come to mind in attempts to reduce lines of seemingly duplicate code is to have just a mutable implementation of an immutable declaration. For example, we can restructure the hierarchy to; sealed interface Contact { val rawContacts : List < RawContact > } data class MutableContact ( override val rawContacts : List < MutableRawContact > ) : Contact sealed interface RawContact { val addresses : List < Address > } data class MutableRawContact ( override var addresses : MutableList < MutableAddress > ) : RawContact sealed interface Address { val formattedAddress : String? } data class MutableAddress ( override var formattedAddress : String? ) : Address Notice that there is a non-concrete declaration (i.e. Contact , RawContact , and Address ) and just one concrete implementation (i.e. MutableContact , MutableRawContact , and MutableAddress ). \u2139\ufe0f A val declaration can be overridden by a var . Keep in mind that val only requires getters whereas var requires both getters and setters. Therefore, a var cannot be overridden by a val . Or maybe there is a different reason Kotlin imposes this restriction. On a similar note, the List interface can be overridden to a MutableList . We, as API contributors, can avoid having to write seemingly duplicate functions and extensions! However! Can you see what's wrong with this setup? If we do this, we would either be deceiving consumers to think that the instances of \"immutable\" class signatures (i.e. Contact , RawContact , and Address ) are actually immutable OR we would have to let consumers know that the API does not really provide true immutability. Neither option is ideal (nor is it acceptable IMO). Consumers would have a reference to a Contact , which they may assume is immutable because of the usage of val instead of var , but in actuality the underlying implementation is mutable... This could be a cause of really hard to find bugs in multi-threaded usage. Consumers may use Contact with the assumption that it is immutable only to find that it can actually be mutated! We could fix this by just making the mutable implementation thread-safe but since that is the only implementation, consumers will be forced to use thread-safe code when they don't have to thereby negatively affecting performance. Keep in mind that thread safety is only one of several reasons for immutability. Those other reasons will be violated too. Consumers will be shocked if they ever do the following or something similar. fun x ( contact : Contact ) = when ( contact ) { is MutableContact -> {} // this is always true is Contact -> {} // this is always true } In any case, I have to admit, it is a nice trick that would save API contributors time. But that's just it! It's just a trick. A shortcut. A nice little time save at the cost of integrity. It is not worth it (IMO). Why Not Add Android X / Support Library Dependencies? \u00b6 I want to keep the dependency list of this library to a minimum. The Contacts Provider is AOSP to Android since the beginning. I want to honor that fact by avoiding adding dependencies here. I made a bit of an exception by adding a permissions handling library for the permissions modules (not in the core modules). I'm tempted to remove the permissions dependency and implement permissions handling myself because external dependencies brings in other dependencies with it. However, it is not part of the core module so I'm able to live with this. Keeping dependencies to a minimum is just a small challenge I made up. We will see how long it can last! I left comments all over the code on when an androidx dependency may be useful. The most glaring example of this is @WorkerThread. Even with that, I'll hold off on adding the androidx annotation lib. I think we can all be consenting adults =) If the community strongly desires the addition of these support libs, then the community will win =)","title":"Developer notes"},{"location":"dev-notes/#developer-notes","text":"This document contains useful developer notes that should be kept in mind during development.

The AOSP Contacts app displays the Contacts.DISPLAY_NAME . So, here comes the unusual scenario that looks like a bug.

The default status of other sources (e.g. email) does not affect the Contact display name. The AOSP Contacts app also sets the most recently updated name as the default at every update. This results in the Contact display name changing to the most recently updated name from one of the associated RawContacts. The \"most recently updated name\" is the name field that was last updated by the user when editing in the Contacts app, which is irrelevant to its value.

All of the above only applies to API 21 and above. Display name resolution is different for APIs below 21 (pre-Lollipop)! The ContactsColumns.NAME_RAW_CONTACT_ID was added in API 21. It changed the way display names are resolved for Contacts with more than one constituent RawContacts, which is what has been described so far.

Unlike the Contact ID, the lookup key is the same across devices (for contacts that are associated with an Account and are synced). \u2139\ufe0f I did the following investigation with a much larger data set. I simplified it here for brevity. Let's take a look at the following Contacts and RawContacts table rows, #### Contacts table Contact id: 55, lookupKey: 0r55-2E4644502A2E50563A503840462E2A404C2A562E4644502A2E50, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Local RawContact Contact id: 56, lookupKey: 2059i6f5de8460f7f227e, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Synced RawContact #### RawContacts table RawContact id: 55, contactId: 55, sourceId: null, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Local RawContact RawContact id: 56, contactId: 56, sourceId: 6f5de8460f7f227e, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Synced RawContact There are two Contacts each having one RawContact. Notice that the lookup keys are a bit different. Contact With Local RawContact: 0r55-2E4644502A2E50563A503840462E2A404C2A562E4644502A2E50 Contact With Synced RawContact: 2059i6f5de8460f7f227e The Contact with synced RawContact uses the RawContact's SOURCE_ID as part of its lookup key. The Contact with unsynced, device-only, local RawContact has a much longer (or shorter e.g. 0r62-2A2C2E) lookup key and starts with \"0r -\" and all characters after it are in uppercase. The other thing to notice is that the \"55\" in \"0r55-\" seems to be the same as the RawContact ID (I did a bit more experiments than what is written in these notes to confirm that it is indeed the RawContact ID and not the Contact ID). We probably don't need to worry about these details though the Contacts Provider probably uses these things internally. We also should not rely on it. However, it may be safe to assume that the Contact lookup key is a reference to a RawContact (or reference to more than one constituent RawContact when multiple RawContacts are linked). Again, an internal Contacts Provider detail we should not rely on BUT is probably relevant when implementing sync adapters. When we link the two, we get... Contact id: 55, lookupKey: 0r55-2E4644502A2E50563A503840462E2A404C2A562E4644502A2E50.2059i6f5de8460f7f227e, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Synced RawContact #### RawContacts table RawContact id: 55, contactId: 55, sorceId: null, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Local RawContact RawContact id: 56, contactId: 55, sourceId: 6f5de8460f7f227e, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Synced RawContact Notice, Contact with ID 56 has been deleted. Contact with ID 55 still exist with the lookup keys of both Contact 55 and 56 combined separated by a \".\" . This holds true in cases where two or more local-only or non-local-only RawContacts are linked. RawContacts remain unchanged except reference to Contact 56 has been replaced with 55. The primary display name of Contact 55 came from RawContact 55 prior to the link and now comes from RawContact 56 after the link. This primary name resolution is probably irrelevant so pay no attention to it. The most important part to notice is that the lookup keys get combined. The lookup uri is required to build a Contacts.CONTENT_LOOKUP_URI ... /** * A content:// style URI for this table that should be used to create * shortcuts or otherwise create long-term links to contacts. This URI * should always be followed by a \"/\" and the contact's {@link #LOOKUP_KEY}. * It can optionally also have a \"/\" and last known contact ID appended after * that.

LookupKey contains lookupKey } The above is correct as long as these assumptions hold true; the lookup key is unique there is no lookup key that can contain a shorter lookup key the Contact ID fails this test because a smaller number is contained in a larger number synced contacts have shorter lookup keys than local contacts. However, local contacts' lookup keys are capitalized whereas synced contact are not. Also, there seems to be other differences in pattern between long and short lookup keys. It should be safe to make this assumption. Until the community finds that this assumption is flawed, we'll assume that it is true! For now, we can avoid having to create another API or extensions just for using lookup keys . When we unlink , we get... #### Contacts table Contact id: 55, lookupKey: 2059i6f5de8460f7f227e, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Synced RawContact Contact id: 58, lookupKey: 0r55-2E4644502A2E50563A503840462E2A404C2A562E4644502A2E50, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Local RawContact #### RawContacts table RawContact id: 55, contactId: 58, sourceId: null, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Local RawContact RawContact id: 56, contactId: 55, sourceId: 6f5de8460f7f227e, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Synced RawContact Notice, A new Contact row with ID of 58 is created. The lookup keys are separated and distributed between Contact 55 and 58. RawContact 55 Contact reference has been set to Contact 58. Let's compare the Contact-RawContact relationship before and after linking and then unlinking. Contact ID Lookup Key RawContact.Contact ID Before 55, 56 0r55-2E4644502A2E50563A503840462E2A404C2A562E4644502A2E50, 2059i6f5de8460f7f227e 55, 56 After 55, 58 2059i6f5de8460f7f227e, 0r55-2E4644502A2E50563A503840462E2A404C2A562E4644502A2E50 58, 55 Notice, Contact ID 55 swapped lookup keys with the former Contact 56 (now 58). RawContact ID 55 swapped Contact reference with RawContact 56. The Contact IDs and lookup keys got shuffled BUT the Contact-RawContact relationship remains the same if using the lookup keys as point of reference! Here is another way to look at the table, using the lookup key as the constant... Lookup Key Before After 0r55-2E4644502A2E50563A503840462E2A404C2A562E4644502A2E50 Contact 55, RawContact 55 Contact 58, RawContact 55 2059i6f5de8460f7f227e Contact 56, RawContact 56 Contact 55, RawContact 56 Notice that the indirect relationship between the lookup key and RawContacts remains the same before and after the link-unlink even though the Contact IDs changed. \u2139\ufe0f As mentioned earlier in this section, the \"55\" in \"0r55-\" seems to be referencing the RawContact ID. In other words, since local RawContacts are not synced or tracked in a remote database where Contacts -> RawContacts mappings exist, the Contacts Provider most likely uses this \"0r -\" pattern to make the connection. This is not really relevant for us as we are not relying on this mechanism. I'm just pointing out my observations, which could be incorrect. This means that... If users of this library saved a reference Contact ID 55, then a link-unlink (or sync adapter functions) occur. Getting Contact by ID 55 will result in the RawContact-Data of the former Contact 56 to be returned. This is a bug! Same goes if users saved a reference to Contact ID 56. If users of this library saved a reference to the lookup keys, then a link-unlink (or sync adapter functions) occur. Getting Contact by lookup key will result in the correct RawContact-Data to be returned. So when to use Contact ID vs lookup key? Lookup key: for a reference to a Contact that needs to be loaded after some period of time. Saving/restoring activity/fragment instance state. Saving to an external database, preferences, or files. Creating shortcuts. ID: for everything else. Performing read/write operations in the same function call or session in your app. Performing read/write operations that require ID (e.g. Contact photo and options). Another thing to check is what happens when associating a local RawContact to an Account (move from device to Account) and vice versa. Is the lookup key of the Contact affected? After associating the local RawContact to an Account... #### Contacts table Contact id: 58, lookupKey: 2059i4abd4a8f8ff89642 #### RawContacts table RawContact id: 55, contactId: 58, sourceId: 2059i4abd4a8f8ff89642 The lookup key changed (since the RawContact's source ID has been assigned the value that came from the sync adapter) but the Contact ID remained the same! In this case, loading a reference to the previously local Contact will fail! I verified that this is indeed the behavior of the AOSP (AOSP) Contacts app. Moving the RawContact from device to Google using Google Contacts app while having Contact details activity opened in the AOSP Contacts app will result in \"error Contact does not exist\" message in the AOSP Contacts app! \u2139\ufe0f The RawContact and its Data also remained the same in this case. Removing the account from it results in... #### Contacts table Contact id: 59, lookupKey: 0r58-2E4644502A2E50563A503840462E2A404C2A562E4644502A2E50 #### RawContacts table RawContact id: 58, contactId: 59, sourceId: null The Contact and RawContacts row have been deleted and new rows have been created to replace them! I also verified that the Data rows have also been deleted and new rows have been created to replace them!

The AOSP Contacts app hides the following UI fields when inserting or updating local raw contacts; Event Relation Group memberships However, the Google Contacts app does not hide any of the above for local raw contacts. Actually, the Contacts Provider does not set any account restrictions with the above data kinds. Lollipop (API 22) and below When an Account is added, from a state where no accounts have yet been added to the system, the Contacts Provider automatically sets all of the null accountName and accountType in the RawContacts table to that Account's name and type; RawContact id: 4, accountName: vestrel00@gmail.com, accountType: com.google RawContact id: 5, accountName: vestrel00@gmail.com, accountType: com.google RawContact id: 6, accountName: vestrel00@gmail.com, accountType: com.google RawContact id: 7, accountName: vestrel00@gmail.com, accountType: com.google RawContacts inserted without an associated account will automatically get assigned to an account if there are any available. This may take a few seconds, whenever the Contacts Provider decides to do it. Dissociating RawContacts from Accounts will result in the Contacts Provider associating those back to an Account. Marshmallow (API 23) and above The Contacts Provider no longer associates local contacts to an account when an account is or becomes available. Local contacts remain local. Account removal Removing the Account will remove all of the associated rows in the local RawContact, Data, and Groups tables. This includes user Profile data in those tables. SyncColumns modifications This library supports modifying the SyncColumns.ACCOUNT_NAME and SyncColumns.ACCOUNT_TYPE of the RawContacts table in some cases only. In some cases does not work as intended and produces unwanted side-effects. It probably has something to do with syncing with remote servers and local Account / sync data not matching up similar to errors on network requests if the system time does not match network time. The motivation behind changing the Account columns of the RawContacts table rows is that it would allow users to; Associate local RawContacts (those that are not associated with an Account) to an Account, allowing syncing between devices. Dissociate RawContacts from their Account such that they remain local to the device and not synced between devices. Transfer RawContacts from one Account to another. When modifying the SyncColumns directly, the first works as intended. The second works with some unwanted side-effects. The third does not work at all and produces unwanted side-effects. These are the behaviors that I have found; Associating local RawContact A to Account X. Works as intended. RawContact A is now associated with Account X and is synced across devices. Dissociating RawContact A (setting the SyncColumns' Account name and type to null) from Account X. Partially works with some unwanted-side effects. Dissociates RawContact A from the device but not other devices. RawContact A is no longer visible in the AOSP Contacts app UNLESS it retains the group membership to at least the default group from an Account. At this point, RawContact A is a local contact. Changes to this local RawContact A will not be synced across devices. If RawContact A is updated in another device and synced up to the server, then a syncing side-effect occurs because the RawContact A in the device is different from the RawContact A in the server. This causes the Contacts Provider to create another RawContact, resulting in a \"duplicate\". The two RawContact As may get aggregated to the same Contact depending on how similar they are. If local RawContact A is re-associated back to Account X, it will still no longer be synced. Associating RawContact A from original Account X to Account Y. Does not work and have bad side-effects. No change in other devices. For Lollipop (API 22) and below, RawContact A is no longer visible in the AOSP Contacts app and syncing Account Y in system settings fails. For Marshmallow (API 23) and above, RawContact A is no longer visible in the AOSP Contacts app. RawContact A is automatically deleted locally at some point by the Contacts Provider. Syncing Account Y in system settings succeeds. Given that associating originally local RawContacts to an Account is the only thing that actually works, it is the only function that will be exposed to consumers. If consumers want to transfer RawContacts from one Account to another, they can create a copy of a RawContact associated with the desired Account and then delete the original RawContact. Same idea can be used to transform an Account-associated RawContact to a local RawContact. Perhaps we can implement some functions in this library that does these things? We won't for now because the AOSP Contacts app does not support these functions anyways. It can always be implemented later if the community really wants. Here are some other things to note. The Contacts Provider automatically creates a group membership to the default group (if exist) of the target Account when the account changes. The Contacts Provider DOES NOT delete existing group memberships when the account changes. UPDATE: My hunch for insert copies then deleting non-null account-associated RawContacts turns to perform an \"account move operation\" turned out to be correct (case 2 and 3). This is what apps like the Google Contacts app does. Actually, Google Contacts app takes it even further by performing insert-delete operation regardless of whether the RawContact is associated to an account or not (cases 1, 2, 3). It does not modify the SyncColumns.ACCOUNT_NAME and SyncColumns.ACCOUNT_TYPE even though case 1 seems to be supported (for now). We should follow what Google Contacts is doing. https://github.com/vestrel00/contacts-android/issues/168","title":"RawContacts; Accounts + Contacts"},{"location":"dev-notes/#rawcontacts-deletion","text":"Deleting a contact's Contacts row, RawContacts row(s), and associated Data row(s) are best explained in the documentation in ContactsContract.RawContacts ; When a raw contact is deleted, all of its Data rows as well as StatusUpdates, AggregationExceptions, PhoneLookup rows are deleted automatically. When all raw contacts associated with a Contacts row are deleted, the Contacts row itself is also deleted automatically. The invocation of resolver.delete(...), does not immediately delete a raw contacts row. Instead, it sets the ContactsContract.RawContactsColumns.DELETED flag on the raw contact and removes the raw contact from its aggregate contact. The sync adapter then deletes the raw contact from the server and finalizes phone-side deletion by calling resolver.delete(...) again and passing the ContactsContract#CALLER_IS_SYNCADAPTER query parameter. Some sync adapters are read-only, meaning that they only sync server-side changes to the phone, but not the reverse. If one of those raw contacts is marked for deletion, it will remain on the phone. However it will be effectively invisible, because it will not be part of any aggregate contact. TLDR To delete a contacts and all associated rows, simply delete all RawContact rows with the desired Contacts id. Deletion of the Contacts row and associated Data row(s) will be done automatically by the Contacts Provider. Note that deleting a RawContacts row may not immediately delete the RawContacts row. In this case, it is marked as deleted and its reference to a contact id is nulled. The Contact may still exist if it still has at least one constituent RawContact that is not marked for deletion. \u2139\ufe0f A RawContact is marked for deletion as specified by RawContactsColumns.DELETED . Typically, deleting RawContacts immediately removes the row from the RawContacts table. However, RawContacts row remains and is simply marked for deletion UNTIL the sync adapters syncs the changes. One of the reasons syncs do not occur is when the system sync settings are turned off for the Account or there is no network connection. Such RawContacts should not be included in query results for Contacts. The AOSP and Google Contacts app also does not show them. Note that local RawContacts rows (not associated with an Account) are deleted immediately as no sync needs to occur.","title":"RawContacts; Deletion"},{"location":"dev-notes/#multiple-rawcontacts-per-contact","text":"Each row in the Contacts table may be associated with more than one row in the RawContacts table.

Contact Y's row has been deleted and its column values have been merged into Contact X row. If the reverse occurred (Contact Y merged with Contact X), Contact Y's row would still be deleted. The difference is that Contact X's display name will be set to Contact Y's display name, which is done by the AOSP Contacts app manually by setting Contact Y's Data name row to be the \"default\" (isPrimary and isSuperPrimary both set to 1). \u2139\ufe0f The AggregationExceptions table records the linked RawContacts' IDs in ascending order regardless of the order used in RAW_CONTACT_ID1 and RAW_CONTACT_ID2 at the time of merging. The RawContacts and Data table remains the same except the joined contactId column values have now been changed to the id of Contact X. All Data rows' isSuperPrimary value has been set to 0 though the isPrimary columns remain the same. In other words, this clears any \"default\" set before the link. These are done automatically by the Contacts Provider during the link operation. What is not done automatically by the Contacts Provider is that the name row of former Contact X is set as the default. The AOSP Contacts app does this manually. The Contacts Providers automatically sets the Contact display name to whatever the default name row is for the Contact, if available. For more info on Contact display name resolution, read the Contact Display Name and Default Name Rows section. \u2139\ufe0f Display name resolution is different for APIs below 21 (pre-lollipop). The display name of the RawContacts remain the same. The Groups table remains unmodified. Options updates Changes to the options (starred, timesContacted, lastTimeContacted, customRingtone, and sendToVoicemail) of a RawContact may affect the options of the parent Contact. On the other hand, changes to the options of the parent Contact will be propagated to all child RawContact options. Photo updates A RawContact may have a full-sized photo saved as a file and a thumbnail version of that saved in the Data table in a photo mimetype row. A Contact's full-sized photo and thumbnail are simply references to the \"chosen\" RawContact's full-sized photo and thumbnail (though the URIs may differ). \u2139\ufe0f When removing the photo in the AOSP contacts app, the photo data row is not immediately deleted, though the PHOTO_FILE_ID is immediately set to null. This may result in the PHOTO_URI and PHOTO_THUMBNAIL_URI to still have a valid image uri even though the photo has been \"removed\". This library immediately deletes the photo data row, which seems to work perfectly. Data inserts In the AOSP Contacts app, Data inserted in combined (raw) contacts mode will be associated to the first RawContact in the list sorted by the RawContact ID. \u2139\ufe0f This may not be the same as the RawContact referenced by ContactsColumns.NAME_RAW_CONTACT_ID . UI changes? The AOSP Contacts App does not display the groups field when displaying / editing Contacts that have multiple RawContacts (linked/merged/joined) in combined mode. However, it does allow editing individual RawContact Data rows in which case the groups field is displayed and editable. In the AOSP Contacts app, the name attribute used comes from the name row with IS_SUPER_PRIMARY set to true. This and all other \"unique\" mimetypes (organization) and non-unique mimetypes (email) per RawContact are shown only if they are not blank. Showing multiple RawContact's data in the same edit screen (combined mode) In older version of the AOSP, Android Open Source Project (AOSP) Contacts app, data from multiple RawContacts was being shown in the same edit screen. This caused a lot of confusion about which data belonged to which RawContact. Newer versions of AOSP Contacts only allow editing one RawContact at a time to avoid confusion. Though, several RawContacts' data are still shown (not-editable) in the same screen.","title":"Behavior of linking/merging/joining contacts (AggregationExceptions)"},{"location":"dev-notes/#aggregationexceptions-table","text":"Given the following Contacts and their RawContacts; Contact A RawContact 1 Contact B RawContact 2 Contact C RawContact 3 Contact D RawContact 4 Linking one by one in this order; Contact B link Contact A Contact C link Contact D Contact C link Contact B Results in the following AggregationExceptions rows respectively; Aggregation exception id: 430, type: 1, rawContactId1: 1, rawContactId2: 2 Aggregation exception id: 430, type: 1, rawContactId1: 1, rawContactId2: 2 Aggregation exception id: 432, type: 1, rawContactId1: 3, rawContactId2: 4 Aggregation exception id: 436, type: 1, rawContactId1: 1, rawContactId2: 2 Aggregation exception id: 439, type: 1, rawContactId1: 1, rawContactId2: 3 Aggregation exception id: 442, type: 1, rawContactId1: 1, rawContactId2: 4 Aggregation exception id: 440, type: 1, rawContactId1: 2, rawContactId2: 3 Aggregation exception id: 443, type: 1, rawContactId1: 2, rawContactId2: 4 Aggregation exception id: 444, type: 1, rawContactId1: 3, rawContactId2: 4 There is a pattern here.

This means that it is possible to set more than one data row of the same mimetype as primary for the same RawContact and super primary for the same aggregate Contact. It is also possible to set a data row as super primary but not primary. Upholding the the contract is left to us... For example, given this relationship; Contact RawContact X Email A Email B RawContact Y Email C Email D When Emails A, B, C, and D are inserted with the RawContacts or after the RawContacts have been created, we get the following state; Email Primary Super Primary A 0 0 B 0 0 C 0 0 D 0 0 The state does not change when RawContact X is linked with RawContact Y. After setting Email A as the \"default\" email, it becomes primary and super primary; Email Primary Super Primary A 1 1 B 0 0 C 0 0 D 0 0 Then setting Email B as the default email, it becomes primary and super primary. Email A is no longer primary or super primary. Email Primary Super Primary A 0 0 B 1 1 C 0 0 D 0 0 Then setting Email C as the default email, it becomes primary and super primary. Email B is still primary because it belongs to a different RawContact than Email C. However, Email B is no longer the super primary as there can only be one per aggregate Contact.

This adds a bit of confusion in my opinion, especially when more than 2, 3, or 4 RawContacts are linked. A \"fix\" would be to only order the list of emails using \"super primary\" instead of \"super primary\" and \"primary\". OR to remove the primary status of the data set of all linked RawContacts.

Creating / setting up the profile in the AOSP Contacts app results in the creation of a local RawContact (not associated with an Account) even if there are available Accounts. The Contacts Provider does not associate local contacts to an account when an account is or becomes available (regardless of API level). Removing the Account will delete all of the associated rows in the Contact, RawContact, Data, and Groups tables. This includes user Profile data in those tables. Profile permissions Profile permissions (READ_PROFILE and WRITE_PROFILE) have been removed since API 23. However, they are still required for API 22 and below. Reading and writing the profile is included in the Contacts permissions. There is no need to ask for profile permissions at runtime because prior to API 23, permissions in the AndroidManifest have to be accepted prior to installation.","title":"User Profile"},{"location":"dev-notes/#syncing-data-sync-adapters","text":"First, it\u2019s good to know the official documentation of sync adapters; https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/contacts-provider#SyncAdapters Now, let\u2019s ingest the official docs\u2026 Data belonging to a RawContact that is associated with a Google account will be available anywhere the Google account is used; in any Android or iOS device, a web browser, etc\u2026 Data is synced by Google\u2019s sync adapters to and from their remote servers.

Whether or not we will change this in the future is debatable =) Consumers are able to set read-only and private or internal variables though because all Entity implementations are data classes. Data classes provide a copy function that allows for setting any property no matter their visibility and even if the constructor is private. As a matter of fact, setting the constructor of a data class as private gives this warning by Android Studio: \"Private data class constructor is exposed via the 'copy' method. There is currently no way to disable the copy function of data classes (that I know of). The only thing we can do is to provide documentation to consumers, insisting against the use of the copy method as it may lead to unwanted side effects when updating and deleting contacts. \u2139\ufe0f We could just use regular classes instead of data classes but entities should be data classes because it is what they are (know what I mean?!).

This restriction may or may not change in the future. Notice that there is nothing mutable in the immutable Contact . Everything are val s and the data structures used (i.e. RawContact , Address , and List ) are all immutable. This provides consumers 100% confidence that immutable entities are not mutable. They will not change or mutate in any way. Once they are constructed, they will always remain the same. Why immutability is so important will not be covered in this dev notes because it would be too big (that's what she said) and there are blogs and books written about this. One of the most important advantages of immutability is that it is thread-safe. Immutable instances can be used in several different threads without the need for synchronization and worries about deadlocks. In other words, they are thread-safe and faster than the mutable version. The current structure also allows consumers to be able to distinguish between immutable and mutable entities exhaustively. E.G. fun doSomethingAndReturn ( contact : ContactEntity ) = when ( contact ) { is Contact -> {} is MutableContact -> {} } \u2139\ufe0f The mutable entities provided in this library are NOT thread-safe .

Notice that the MutableContact does not inherit from Contact . The same goes for the other entities. This leads to having to write seemingly duplicate code when writing functions and extensions. // FIXME? Furthermore, equality between immutable and mutable entities are not yet implemented. This means that Contact(\"john\") == MutableContact(\"john\") will return false even though their underlying contents are the same. This can be fixed by overriding the equals and hashcode functions of all entities. However, that is a lot more code that I would like to avoid, which is why I'm using data class for all entities in the first place! This may change in the future if the community really wants to change it =) On a side note, the same cost is incurred by Kotlin's standard libs. For example, notice that AbstractMutableList does not inherit from and is completely separate from AbstractList .

Keep in mind that val only requires getters whereas var requires both getters and setters. Therefore, a var cannot be overridden by a val . Or maybe there is a different reason Kotlin imposes this restriction. On a similar note, the List interface can be overridden to a MutableList . We, as API contributors, can avoid having to write seemingly duplicate functions and extensions! However! Can you see what's wrong with this setup? If we do this, we would either be deceiving consumers to think that the instances of \"immutable\" class signatures (i.e. Contact , RawContact , and Address ) are actually immutable OR we would have to let consumers know that the API does not really provide true immutability. Neither option is ideal (nor is it acceptable IMO). Consumers would have a reference to a Contact , which they may assume is immutable because of the usage of val instead of var , but in actuality the underlying implementation is mutable... This could be a cause of really hard to find bugs in multi-threaded usage. Consumers may use Contact with the assumption that it is immutable only to find that it can actually be mutated! We could fix this by just making the mutable implementation thread-safe but since that is the only implementation, consumers will be forced to use thread-safe code when they don't have to thereby negatively affecting performance. Keep in mind that thread safety is only one of several reasons for immutability. Those other reasons will be violated too. Consumers will be shocked if they ever do the following or something similar. fun x ( contact : Contact ) = when ( contact ) { is MutableContact -> {} // this is always true is Contact -> {} // this is always true } In any case, I have to admit, it is a nice trick that would save API contributors time.

The fields defined in contacts.core.Fields.kt specify what properties of entities to include in read and write operations. For example, to include only the contact display name, organization company, and all phone number fields in a query/insert/update operation, queryInsertUpdate . include ( mutableSetOf < AbstractDataField > (). apply { add ( Fields . Contact . DisplayNamePrimary ) add ( Fields . Organization . Company ) addAll ( Fields . Phone . all ) }) The following entity properties are are used in the read/write operation, Contact { displayNamePrimary RawContact { organization { company } phones { number normalizedNumber type label } } } \u2139\ufe0f For more info, read about API Entities . To explicitly include everything, query . include ( Fields . all ) \u2139\ufe0f Not invoking the include function will default to including everything, including custom data. The above code will exclude custom data. Read the Custom data support section for more info. The matching contacts may have non-null data corresponding to each of the included fields. Fields that are included will not guarantee non-null data in the returned contact instances because some data may actually be null in the database. If no fields are specified, then all fields are included. Otherwise, only the specified fields will be included in addition to required API fields (e.g. IDs), which are always included. \u2139\ufe0f This may affect performance. It is recommended to only include fields that will be used to save CPU and memory. Using include in query APIs \u00b6 When using query APIs such as Query , BroadQuery , PhoneLookupQuery , RawContactsQuery , ProfileQuery , and DataQuery , you are able to specify all or only some kinds of data that you want to be included in the returned results. When all fields are included in a query operation, all properties of Contacts, RawContacts, and Data are populated with values from the database. Properties of fields that are included are not guaranteed to be non-null because the database may actually have no data for the corresponding field. When only some fields are included, only those included properties of Contacts, RawContacts, and Data are populated with values from the database. Properties of fields that are not included are guaranteed to be null. Optimizing queries \u00b6 Are you finding that your queries are slow or take too much memory? Are you looking to optimize your queries? Well, you are in the right section! When you are showing a list of Contacts using the Query and BroadQuery APIs, you typically only show their thumbnail photo and display name. . include ( Fields . Contact . PhotoThumbnailUri , Fields . Contact . DisplayNamePrimary ) If instead you are showing a list of RawContacts directly instead of Contacts using the RawContactsQuery , you typically only show their display name. . includeRawContactsFields ( RawContactsFields . DisplayNamePrimary ) In such cases, you should only include those fields in order to increase speed and lessen memory usage. Here is a sample benchmark running on an M1 MacBook Pro using a Pixel 4 API 30 emulator in Android Studio. The Contacts Provider database contains 10,000 contacts each having exactly one address, email, event, im, name, nickname, note, organization, phone, relation, sip address, and website. Getting all 10,000 contacts including only fields from Fields.Contact using the following query, val contacts = Contacts ( context ) . broadQuery () . include ( Fields . Contact . LookupKey , Fields . Contact . DisplayNamePrimary ) . find () takes between 99 to 144 milliseconds =) \u2139\ufe0f As of version 0.2.4 , including only fields from Fields.Contact in Query and BroadQuery API calls will result in the fastest and most memory efficient queries. Prior versions do not have this extra optimization, though including less fields still result in faster queries. Prior versions will take on average 1334 milliseconds for the same query above. Getting all 10,000 contacts including ALL fields using the following query, val contacts = Contacts ( context ). broadQuery (). find () takes between 2953 to 3009 milliseconds =( Using include in insert APIs \u00b6 When using insert APIs such as Insert and ProfileInsert , you are able to specify all or only some kinds of data that you want to be included in the insert operation. When all fields are included in an insert operation, all properties of Contacts, RawContacts, and Data are inserted into the database. When only some fields are included, only those included properties of Contacts, RawContacts, and Data are inserted into the database. Properties of fields that are not included are NOT inserted into the database. Using include in update APIs \u00b6 When using update APIs such as Update , ProfileUpdate , and DataUpdate , you are able to specify all or only some kinds of data that you want to be included in the update operation. An \"update\" operation consists of insertion, updates, and deletions \u00b6 To ensure that the database matches the data contained in the entities being passed into the update operation, a combination of insert, update, or delete operations are performed internally by the update API. The following is what constitutes an \"updated\" event; A RawContact can have 0 or 1 name. If it is null or blank, then the update operation will... delete the name row of the RawContact from the database, if it exist If it is not null, then the update operation will do one of the following... update an existing name row, if it exist or insert a new name row, if one does not exist A RawContact can have 0, 1 or more emails. If the list of emails is empty (or contains only blanks), then the update operation will... delete all email rows of the RawContact from the database, if any exist If the list of emails is not empty, then the update operation will do all of the following... update email rows for emails that already exist in the database insert new email rows for emails that do not yet exist in the database delete email rows for emails that exist in the database but not in the (in-memory) entity Blank data are deleted \u00b6 Blank data are deleted from the database, unless the the complete set of corresponding fields are not included in the update operation. \u26a0\ufe0f Prior to version 0.2.1 , before include in update APIs have been overhauled , blank data are deleted from the database even if the corresponding fields are not included. \u2139\ufe0f For more info on blank data, read about Blank data . Including complete field sets for \"update\" \u00b6 When all fields are included in an update operation, all properties of Contacts, RawContacts, and Data are \"updated\" in the database. When only some fields are included, only those included properties of Contacts, RawContacts, and Data are \"updated\" in the database. Properties of fields that are not included are NOT \"updated\" . To get all contacts including all fields, then modify the emails, phones, and addresses and perform an update operation on all fields, val contacts = query . find () val contactsWithModifiedEmailPhoneAddress = modifyEmailPhoneAddressIn ( contacts ) update . contacts ( contactsWithModifiedEmailPhoneAddress ). commit () To modify all emails of all contacts without updating anything else into the database, val contactsWithOnlyEmailData = query . include ( Fields . Email . all ). find () val contactsWithModifiedEmailData = modifyEmailsIn ( contactsWithOnlyEmailData ) update . contacts ( contactsWithModifiedEmailData ). include ( Fields .

Email . all ). commit () Including a subset of field sets for \"update\" \u00b6 Including only a subset of a set of fields results in, deletion of blanks (same as if the complete set of fields are included) update of properties corresponding to included fields no-op on properties corresponding to excluded fields For example, the following set the given name and family name to the non-null values but does not set all others (i.e. display name, middle name, prefix, suffix, phonetic given middle family name). contacts . update () . include ( Fields . Name . GivenName , Fields . Name . FamilyName , ) . rawContacts ( existingRawContact . mutableCopy { setName { displayName = \"Mr. \" prefix = \"Mr.\" givenName = \"First\" middleName = \"Middle\" familyName = \"Last\" suffix = \"Jr.\" phoneticGivenName = \"fUHRst\" phoneticMiddleName = \"mIdl\" phoneticFamilyName = \"lAHst\" } } ) . commit () If the name row for the RawContact did not exist before the update operation, then a new name row will be inserted into the database for the RawContact. The given name and family name columns will be set to the specified values. All other columns will be set to null.

Executing the query \u00b6 To execute the query, . find () Cancelling the query \u00b6 To cancel a query amid execution, . find { returnTrueIfQueryShouldBeCancelled () } The find function optionally takes in a function that, if it returns true, will cancel query processing as soon as possible. The function is called numerous times during query processing to check if processing should stop or continue. This gives you the option to cancel the query. This is useful when used in multi-threaded environments. One scenario where this would be frequently used is when performing queries as the user types a search text. You are able to cancel the current query when the user enters new text. For example, to automatically cancel the query inside a Kotlin coroutine when the coroutine is cancelled, launch { withContext ( coroutineContext ) { val contacts = query . find { ! isActive } } } Performing the query asynchronously \u00b6 Queries are executed when the find function is invoked. The work is done in the same thread as the call-site. This may result in a choppy UI. To perform the work in a different thread, use the Kotlin coroutine extensions provided in the async module. For more info, read Execute work outside of the UI thread using coroutines . You may, of course, use other multi-threading libraries or just do it yourself =) \u2139\ufe0f Extensions for Kotlin Flow and RxJava are also in the project roadmap, which includes APIs for listening to Contacts database changes. Performing the query with permission \u00b6 Queries require the android.permission.READ_CONTACTS permission. If not granted, the query will do nothing and return an empty list. To perform the query with permission, use the extensions provided in the permissions module. For more info, read Permissions handling using coroutines . You may, of course, use other permission handling libraries or just do it yourself =) Custom data support \u00b6 The Query API supports custom data. For more info, read Query custom data . Using the where function to specify matching criteria \u00b6 Use the contacts.core.Fields combined with the extensions from contacts.core.Where to form WHERE clauses. \u2139\ufe0f This docs page will not provide a tutorial on database where clauses. It assumes that you know the basics. If you don't know the basics, then search for sqlite where clause . For example, to get all contacts with a phone number AND email, val contacts = Contacts ( context ) . query () ... . where { Phone . Number . isNotNullOrEmpty () and Email . Address . isNotNullOrEmpty () } . find () To get a list of contacts with the given IDs, val contacts = Contacts ( context ) . query () ... . where { Contact . Id `in` contactIds } . find () Performance \u00b6 Using where may require one or more additional queries, internally performed by the API, which increases the time it takes for the query to complete. Therefore, you should only use where if you actually need it. For every usage of the and operator where the left-hand-side and right-hand-side are different data kinds, an internal database query is performed. This is due to the way the Data table is structured in relation to Contacts. For example, Email . Address . isNotNull () and Phone . Number . isNotNull () and Address . FormattedAddress . isNotNull () The above will require two additional internal database queries in order to simplify the query such that it can actually provide matching Contacts. Using the or operator does not have this performance hit. Groups Matching \u00b6 Unlike BroadQuery.groups , this does not have a groups function. You may still match groups (in a much flexible way) by using Fields.GroupMembership with where . Limitations \u00b6 This library only provides basic WHERE functions. It does not cover the entirety of SQLite, though the community may add more over time <3 Furthermore, this library is constrained by rules and limitations set by the Contacts Provider and the behavior of the AOSP Contacts app. One such rule/limitation has resulted in this library not providing WHERE functions such as isNull or isNullOrEmpty to prevent making misleading queries. Removing a piece of existing data results in the deletion of the row in the Data table if that row no longer contains any meaningful data. This is the behavior of the AOSP Contacts app. Therefore, querying for null fields is not possible. For example, there may be no Data rows that exist where the email address is null. Thus, a query to search for all contacts with no email addresses may return 0 contacts even if there are some contacts that do not have at least one email address. If you want to match contacts that has no particular type of data, you will have to make two queries. One to get contacts that have that particular type of data and another to get contacts that were not part of the first query results. For example, val contactsWithEmails = query . include ( Fields . Contact . Id ) . where { Email . Address . isNotNullOrEmpty () } . find () val contactIdsWithEmails = contactsWithEmails . mapNotNull { it . id } val contactsWithoutEmails = query . where { Contact . Id notIn contactIdsWithEmails } . find () There is a special case with phone numbers. The ContactsContract provides a field that is true if the contact has at least one phone number; Fields.Contact.HasPhoneNumber . The phone number is the only kind of data that the ContactsContract provides with an indexed value such as this. The ContactsContract does NOT provide things like \"hasEmail\", \"hasWebsite\", etc. Regardless, this library provide functions to match contacts that \"has at least one instance of a kind of data\". The HasPhoneNumber field is not necessary to get contacts that have a phone number. However, this does provide an easy way to get contacts that have no phone numbers without having to make two queries. For example, val contactsWithNoPhoneNumbers = query . where { Contact . HasPhoneNumber notEqualTo true } . find ()","title":"Query contacts (advanced)"},{"location":"basics/query-contacts-advanced/#query-contacts-advanced","text":"This library provides the Query API that allows you to get a list of Contacts matching a specific search criteria.

The function is called numerous times during query processing to check if processing should stop or continue. This gives you the option to cancel the query. This is useful when used in multi-threaded environments. One scenario where this would be frequently used is when performing queries as the user types a search text. You are able to cancel the current query when the user enters new text. For example, to automatically cancel the query inside a Kotlin coroutine when the coroutine is cancelled, launch { withContext ( coroutineContext ) { val contacts = query . find { ! isActive } } } Performing the query asynchronously \u00b6 Queries are executed when the find function is invoked. The work is done in the same thread as the call-site. This may result in a choppy UI. To perform the work in a different thread, use the Kotlin coroutine extensions provided in the async module. For more info, read Execute work outside of the UI thread using coroutines . You may, of course, use other multi-threading libraries or just do it yourself =) \u2139\ufe0f Extensions for Kotlin Flow and RxJava are also in the project roadmap, which includes APIs for listening to Contacts database changes. Performing the query with permission \u00b6 Queries require the android.permission.READ_CONTACTS permission. If not granted, the query will do nothing and return an empty list. To perform the query with permission, use the extensions provided in the permissions module. For more info, read Permissions handling using coroutines . You may, of course, use other permission handling libraries or just do it yourself =) Custom data support \u00b6 The PhoneLookupQuery API does not include custom data in the matching process. However, you may still use the include function with custom data. For more info, read Query custom data . Using the match and whereExactlyMatches functions to specify matching criteria \u00b6 The PhoneLookupQuery API lets the Contacts Provider perform the search using its own custom matching algorithm via the whereExactlyMatches function. This will only match EXACT phone numbers or SIP addresses of different formatting and variations. There is no partial matching. There are several different types of matching algorithms that can be used. The type is set via the match function. Custom data are not included in the matching process! To match custom data, use Query . Match.PHONE \u00b6 Match phone numbers. This is useful in cases where you want to implement a caller ID function for incoming and outgoing calls. This is the default. For example, if there are contacts with the following numbers; 123 1234 1234 12345 Searching for \"123\" will only return the one contact with the number \"123\". Searching for \"1234\" will return the contact(s) with the number \"1234\". Additionally, this is able to match phone numbers with or without using country codes. For example, the phone number \"+923123456789\" (country code 92) will be matched using any of the following; \"03123456789\", \"923123456789\", \"+923123456789\". The reverse is true. For example, the phone number \"03123456789\" will be matched using any of the following; \"03123456789\", \"923123456789\", \"+923123456789\". However, if a phone number is saved with AND without a country code, then only the contact with the number that matches exactly will be returned. For example, when numbers \"+923123456789\" and \"03123456789\" are saved, searching for \"03123456789\" will return only the contact with that exact number (NOT including the contact with \"+923123456789\"). \u2139\ufe0f Matching is not strictly based on the PhoneEntity.normalizedNumber (E164 representation) if it is not null. In cases where it is null, matching will be done strictly based on the PhoneEntity.number . Match.SIP \u00b6 Same as Match.PHONE except this matches SIP addresses instead of phone numbers. \u26a0\ufe0f This is only available for API 21 and above. The Match.PHONE will be used for API versions below 21 even if Match.SIP is specified.","title":"Query contacts by phone or SIP"},{"location":"basics/query-contacts-by-phone-or-sip/#query-contacts-by-phone-or-sip","text":"This library provides the PhoneLookupQuery API that performs a highly optimized query using a phone number or SIP address.

There are several different types of matching algorithms that can be used. The type is set via the match function. Matching is case-insensitive (case is ignored). Custom data are not included in the matching process! To match custom data, use Query . Match.ANY \u00b6 Most, but not all, Contact data are included in the matching process. E.G. name, email, phone, address, organization, note, etc. Use this if you want to get the same results when searching contacts using the AOSP Contacts app and the Google Contacts app. Data matching is more sophisticated under the hood than Query . The Contacts Provider matches parts of several types of data in segments. For example, a Contact having the email \"hologram@gram.net\" will be matched with the following texts; h HOLO @g @gram.net gram@ net holo.net hologram.net But will NOT be matched with the following texts; olo @ gram@gram am@gram.net Similarly, a Contact having the name \"Zack Air\" will be matched with the following texts; z zack zack, air air, zack za a , z , a ,a But will NOT be matched with the following texts; ack ir , Another example is a Contact having the note \"Lots of spa ces.\" will be matched with the following texts; l lots lots of of lots ces spa lots of. lo o sp ce . . . . . But will NOT be matched with the following texts; . ots Several types of data are matched in segments. E.G. A Contact with display name \"Bell Zee\" and phone numbers \"987\", \"1 23\", and \"456\" will be matched with \"be bell ze 9 123 1 98 456\". Match.PHONE \u00b6 Only phones or (contact display name + any phones) are included in the matching process. Use this if you want to get contacts that have a matching phone number or matching ( Contact.displayNamePrimary + any phone number). If you are attempting to matching contacts with phone numbers using Query , then you will most likely find it to difficult and tricky because the normalizedNumber could be null and matching formatted numbers (e.g. (718) 737-1991) would require some special regular expressions. This match might just be what you need =) Only the Contact.displayNamePrimary and the phone number/normalizedNumber are included in the matching process. For example, a contact with Contact.displayNamePrimary of \"Bob Dole\" and phone number \"(718) 737-1991\" (regardless of the value of normalizedNumber) will be matched with the following texts; 718 7187371991 7.1-8.7-3.7-19(91) bob dole Notice that \"bob\" and \"dole\" will trigger a match because the display name matches and the contact has a phone number. The following texts will NOT trigger a match because the comparison begins at the beginning of the string and not in the middle or end; 737 1991 Match.EMAIL \u00b6 Only emails or (contact display name + any emails) are included in the matching process. Only the Contact.displayNamePrimary and the email address are included in the matching process. For example, the search text \"bob\" will match the following contacts; Robert Parr (bob@incredibles.com) Bob Parr (incredible@android.com) Notice that the contact Bob Parr is also matched because the display name matches and an email exist (even though it does not match). The following search texts will NOT trigger a match because the comparison begins at the beginning of the string and not in the middle or end; android gmail @ .com Developer notes (or for advanced users) \u00b6 Matching only by phone number or email address is possible thanks to the following filter Uris defined in ContactsContract , which exist for this specific purpose. ContactsContract { Contacts { CONTENT_FILTER_URI } // Default used by BroadQuery CommonDataKinds { Phone { CONTENT_FILTER_URI } Email { CONTENT_FILTER_URI } } } These special filter URIs are only available for the phone and email common data kinds. Note that the EMAIL and PHONE additionally matches the contact display name. Comparison table \u00b6 I've done some preliminary testing on the differences between the different matching/filter algorithms. So, given the following contacts... Display name: Robert Parr Email: bob@incredibles.com Display name: Bob Parr Email: incredible@android.com Display name: Bob Dole Phone: (718) 737-1991 Display name: vestrel00@gmail.com Email: vestrel00@gmail.com Display name: 646-123-4567 Phone: 646-123-4567 Display name: Secret agent. Address: Dole street Company: 718 Note: Agent code is 646000. His skills are incredible! Here are some search terms followed by matching contacts based on the type of Match used. Search term ANY PHONE EMAIL bob 1, 2, 3 3 1, 2 incredible 1, 2, 6 2 android 2 gmail 4 .com 1, 2, 4 @ 7187371991 3 3 7.1-8.7-3.7-19(91) 3 3 646 5, 6 5 646-646 6 718 3, 6 3 1991 4567 000 dole 3, 6 3 The above table gives us some insight on how sophisticated the matching (or search / indexing) algorithm is. For the search term \"bob\", PHONE matches contact 3. Display name matches and contact has a phone even though it does match. EMAIL matches contact 1, 2. 1 has a matching email \"bob\". 2 is also matched because the name matches even though the email does not. On the other hand, 3 is NOT matched even though the name matches because 3 has no email. Adding an email to 3 will cause 3 to be matched. For the search term \"incredible\", EMAIL matches 2 (incredible@android.com) but NOT 1 (bob@incredibles.com). This means that email matching does not use contains but rather a form of startsWith . TLDR ANY matches any contact data; name, email, phone, address, organization, note, etc. EMAIL matches emails or (display name + any email) PHONE matches phones or (display name + any phone) EMAIL and PHONE matching is NOT as simple as using the Query API with .where { [Email|Phone] contains searchTerm }","title":"Query contacts"},{"location":"basics/query-contacts/#query-contacts","text":"This library provides the BroadQuery API that allows you to get the exact same search results as the AOSP Contacts app!

Limiting and offsetting \u00b6 To limit the amount of blocked numbers returned and/or offset (skip) a specified number of blocked numbers, use the limit and offset functions; . limit ( limit ) . offset ( offset ) For more info, read Using limit and offset in queries . Executing the query \u00b6 To execute the query, . find () Cancelling the query \u00b6 To cancel a query amid execution, . find { returnTrueIfQueryShouldBeCancelled () } The find function optionally takes in a function that, if it returns true, will cancel query processing as soon as possible. The function is called numerous times during query processing to check if processing should stop or continue. This gives you the option to cancel the query. This is useful when used in multi-threaded environments. One scenario where this would be frequently used is when performing queries as the user types a search text. You are able to cancel the current query when the user enters new text. For example, to automatically cancel the query inside a Kotlin coroutine when the coroutine is cancelled, launch { withContext ( coroutineContext ) { val blockedNumbers = query . find { ! isActive } } } Performing the query asynchronously \u00b6 Queries are executed when the find function is invoked.

Providing sync adapters to sync custom data across devices. This library only handles the first part. If you want to sync your custom data, then you need to implement a sync adapter to interface with your remote server. That is out of scope of this library. In order to create and integrate your own custom data for use in your own apps, there is a bit of boilerplate code that needs to be written. Thankfully none of this stuff is difficult! Here are the steps, in chronological order, on how to define and use your own custom data, Define the mimetype Define the entities Define the fields Implement the cursor Implement the mapper Implement the operation Define the count restriction Define RawContact getters and setters Define Contact getters and setters Define exceptions Implement the field mapper Define the data query function Define the custom data entry Define the custom data entry registration Register your custom data with the Contacts API instance Use your custom data in queries, inserts, updates, and deletes \u2139\ufe0f Maybe someday someone with code generation experience (or I'll learn how to do it), will create annotations and annotation processors to eliminate having to manually write this stuff =) To help illustrate the above steps, we'll use the HandleName and Gender custom data provided in this library's customdata-handlename and customdata-gender respectively as an example. \u2139\ufe0f For more specifics on these custom data, read Integrate the gender custom data and Integrate the handle name custom data . At the bottom of this page, we'll also discuss, Consider adding your custom data to this library Custom data without sync adapters will not be synced Displaying your custom data in other Contacts apps Summary of limitations \u2139\ufe0f Some of the code used in these examples are in Kotlin. If you would like a Java version of this page, create an issue in GitHub. You are also free to file a pull request with your own page. In the event that a Java version of this page is created, this quote block should be replaced with a link to that page. 1. Define the mimetype \u00b6 The mimetype is a string that describes what kind of data a row in the Data table represents. For Gender , internal object GenderMimeType : MimeType . Custom () { // Following Contacts Provider convention of \"vnd.android.cursor.item/<package>.<mimetype>\" override val value : String = \"vnd.android.cursor.item/contacts.entities.custom.gender\" } For HandleName , internal object HandleNameMimeType : MimeType . Custom () { // Following Contacts Provider convention of \"vnd.android.cursor.item/<package>.<mimetype>\" override val value : String = \"vnd.android.cursor.item/contacts.entities.custom.handlename\" } Do not change the mimetype value! If you have already deployed apps to production that use these mimetype values, then changing them could result in \"data loss\". Old rows in the Data table will not be compatible if the mimetype value changes. You can certainly perform migrations by creating a new custom data altogether and migrating your old custom data to your new one. Do not use built-in mimetypes! The Contacts Provider has predefined the mimetypes for all of the common data kinds it supports (e.g. email). Make sure that your custom data does not use any of those. You can take a look at built-in mimetypes in contacs.core.entities.MimeType.kt . But, here they are for your convenience =) Builtin data kind mimetype Address \"vnd.android.cursor.item/postal-address_v2\" Email \"vnd.android.cursor.item/email_v2\" Event \"vnd.android.cursor.item/contact_event\" GroupMembership \"vnd.android.cursor.item/group_membership\" Im \"vnd.android.cursor.item/im\" Name \"vnd.android.cursor.item/name\" Nickname \"vnd.android.cursor.item/nickname\" Note \"vnd.android.cursor.item/note\" Organization \"vnd.android.cursor.item/organization\" Phone \"vnd.android.cursor.item/phone_v2\" Photo \"vnd.android.cursor.item/photo\" Relation \"vnd.android.cursor.item/relation\" SipAddress \"vnd.android.cursor.item/sip_address\" Website \"vnd.android.cursor.item/website\" 2. Define the entities \u00b6 The entities are the main code that users of your custom data will be exposed to. The properties model/represent the fields/columns in the Data table. Due to the length of the Gender.kt and HandleName.kt files, I will not be copy-pasting them here. Please take a look at those files instead. A few things to note, Either inherit from CustomDataEntity or CustomDataEntityWithTypeAndLabel . Implement the mimeType using the mimetype you defined in the previous step. Implement the isBlank using the contacts.core.entities.propertiesAreAllNullOrBlank function. Put the properties that you consider to be important such that if they are null, then the data is useless (blank). Define an immutable class so that instances can be returned on queries. These would also need to inherit from ExistingCustomDataEntity and ImmutableCustomDataEntityWithMutableType (or ImmutableCustomDataEntityWithNullableMutableType ). All properties and types defined here must be immutable ( val ). Define a mutable class so that instances can be updated. These would also need to inherit from ExistingCustomDataEntity . Only modifiable fields should have properties and types defined as mutable ( var ). Define a \"new\" class so that instances can be inserted. These would also need to inherit from NewCustomDataEntity . Only modifiable fields should have properties and types defined as mutable ( var ). Properties that map to your custom data fields should be nullable ( ? ). The following properties should always be immutable ( val ); id , rawContactId , contactId , isPrimary , isSuperPrimary , and isRedacted . Be mindful of what properties should be redacted when implementing the redactedCopy function. All entity class must implement Parecelable . 3. Define the fields \u00b6 Fields (or columns) represent (or map to) one of the properties you defined in the previous step. These are used in queries, inserts, and update operations. For Gender , data class GenderField internal constructor ( private val columnName : ColumnName ) : AbstractCustomDataField ( columnName ) { override val customMimeType : MimeType . Custom = GenderMimeType } object GenderFields : AbstractCustomDataFieldSet < GenderField > () { @JvmField val Type = GenderField ( ColumnName . TYPE ) @JvmField val Label = GenderField ( ColumnName . LABEL ) override val all : Set < GenderField > = setOf ( Type , Label ) override val forMatching : Set < GenderField > = emptySet () } For HandleName , data class HandleNameField internal constructor ( private val columnName : ColumnName ) : AbstractCustomDataField ( columnName ) { override val customMimeType : MimeType . Custom = HandleNameMimeType } object HandleNameFields : AbstractCustomDataFieldSet < HandleNameField > () { @JvmField val Handle = HandleNameField ( ColumnName . DATA ) override val all : Set < HandleNameField > = setOf ( Handle ) override val forMatching : Set < HandleNameField > = setOf ( Handle ) } A few things to note, You need to define a AbstractCustomDataField and a AbstractCustomDataFieldSet . Annotate your field instances with @JvmField to make it more accessible for Java users. This is only helpful if you are writing code for other people to use. Carefully choose what to put in all and forMatching . If you are using ColumnName.BLOB , do not put it in all or forMatching ! For more info, read the in-code documentation on it. 4. Implement the cursor \u00b6 Cursors read the values from the Data table and convert them into the types you want (e.g. String). For Gender , internal class GenderDataCursor ( cursor : Cursor , includeFields : Set < GenderField > ) : AbstractCustomDataCursor < GenderField > ( cursor , includeFields ) { val type : GenderEntity . Type ? by type ( GenderFields . Type , typeFromValue = GenderEntity . Type :: fromValue ) val label : String? by string ( GenderFields . Label ) } For HandleName , internal class HandleNameDataCursor ( cursor : Cursor , includeFields : Set < HandleNameField > ) : AbstractCustomDataCursor < HandleNameField > ( cursor , includeFields ) { val handle : String? by string ( HandleNameFields . Handle ) } A few things to note, Inheritors of AbstractCustomDataCursor have access to several regular and delegate functions that extract data. All of them are defined in contacts.core.entities.cursor.AbstractEntityCursor . If you are using Java, you are only able to use the regular functions. The delegate functions are prettier but use Kotlin reflection, which could slightly affect runtime performance. You can either extract nullable or non-nullable values using these functions. 5. Implement the mapper \u00b6 Mappers use the cursors implemented in the previous step in order to create instances of your custom data entities. For Gender , internal class GenderMapperFactory : AbstractCustomDataEntityMapper . Factory < GenderField , GenderDataCursor , Gender > { override fun create ( cursor : Cursor , includeFields : Set < GenderField > ): AbstractCustomDataEntityMapper < GenderField , GenderDataCursor , Gender > = GenderMapper ( GenderDataCursor ( cursor , includeFields )) } private class GenderMapper ( cursor : GenderDataCursor ) : AbstractCustomDataEntityMapper < GenderField , GenderDataCursor , Gender > ( cursor ) { override fun value ( cursor : GenderDataCursor ) = Gender ( id = cursor . dataId , rawContactId = cursor . rawContactId , contactId = cursor . contactId , isPrimary = cursor . isPrimary , isSuperPrimary = cursor . isSuperPrimary , type = cursor . type , label = cursor . label , isRedacted = false ) } For HandleName , internal class HandleNameMapperFactory : AbstractCustomDataEntityMapper . Factory < HandleNameField , HandleNameDataCursor , HandleName > { override fun create ( cursor : Cursor , includeFields : Set < HandleNameField > ): AbstractCustomDataEntityMapper < HandleNameField , HandleNameDataCursor , HandleName > = HandleNameMapper ( HandleNameDataCursor ( cursor , includeFields )) } private class HandleNameMapper ( cursor : HandleNameDataCursor ) : AbstractCustomDataEntityMapper < HandleNameField , HandleNameDataCursor , HandleName > ( cursor ) { override fun value ( cursor : HandleNameDataCursor ) = HandleName ( id = cursor . dataId , rawContactId = cursor . rawContactId , contactId = cursor . contactId , isPrimary = cursor . isPrimary , isSuperPrimary = cursor . isSuperPrimary , handle = cursor . handle , isRedacted = false ) } A few things to note, This requires definitions and implementations done in the previous steps. If you are having compile-time issues at this point, make sure that you did not skip a step! Ensure that isRedacted is set to false (unless you are already performing the redaction) here. 6. Implement the operation \u00b6 Operations are used for inserts and updates from in-memory instances of your entities to the database. For Gender , internal class GenderOperationFactory : AbstractCustomDataOperation . Factory < GenderField , GenderEntity > { override fun create ( isProfile : Boolean , includeFields : Set < GenderField > ): AbstractCustomDataOperation < GenderField , GenderEntity > = GenderOperation ( isProfile , includeFields ) } private class GenderOperation ( isProfile : Boolean , includeFields : Set < GenderField > ) : AbstractCustomDataOperation < GenderField , GenderEntity > ( isProfile , includeFields ) { override val mimeType : MimeType . Custom = GenderMimeType override fun setCustomData ( data : GenderEntity , setValue : ( field : GenderField , value : Any? ) -> Unit ) { setValue ( GenderFields . Type , data . type ?. value ) setValue ( GenderFields . Label , data . label ) } } For HandleName , internal class HandleNameOperationFactory : AbstractCustomDataOperation . Factory < HandleNameField , HandleNameEntity > { override fun create ( isProfile : Boolean , includeFields : Set < HandleNameField > ): AbstractCustomDataOperation < HandleNameField , HandleNameEntity > = HandleNameOperation ( isProfile , includeFields ) } private class HandleNameOperation ( isProfile : Boolean , includeFields : Set < HandleNameField > ) : AbstractCustomDataOperation < HandleNameField , HandleNameEntity > ( isProfile , includeFields ) { override val mimeType : MimeType . Custom = HandleNameMimeType override fun setCustomData ( data : HandleNameEntity , setValue : ( field : HandleNameField , value : Any? ) -> Unit ) { setValue ( HandleNameFields . Handle , data . handle ) } } A few things to note, You just need to use your custom data fields and the corresponding data property it maps to in the setValue function provided in the setCustomData function. 7. Define the count restriction \u00b6 The count restriction defines whether a RawContact can have 0 or 1 of your custom data or if it can have 0, 1, or more. For Gender , /** * A RawContact may have at most 1 gender. */ internal val GENDER_COUNT_RESTRICTION = CustomDataCountRestriction . AT_MOST_ONE For HandleName , /** * A RawContact may have 0, 1, or more handle names. */ internal val HANDLE_NAME_COUNT_RESTRICTION = CustomDataCountRestriction . NO_LIMIT 8. Define RawContact getters and setters \u00b6 In order for you or your consumers to be able to get and set your custom data in instances of RawContacts they belong to, you must define a set of getters and setters. Due to the length of the RawContactGender.kt and RawContactHandleName.kt files, I will not be copy-pasting them here. Please take a look at those files instead. A few things to note, For getters, use the Contacts.customDataRegistry.customDataEntitiesFor function to extract the custom data instance(s) for the RawContact with your custom mimetype. Consider returning Sequence for the getters for optimizations in Kotlin. For setters use, the Contacts.customDataRegistry.putCustomDataEntityInto function to set the custom data instance into the RawContact. the Contacts.customDataRegistry.removeAllCustomDataEntityFrom function to remove the custom data instance from the RawContact. Define getters and setters for RawContact , MutableRawContact , and NewRawContact . Ensure to match the type of RawContact with the type of the custom data. For example, RawContact -> Gender , HandleName MutableRawContact -> MutableGenderEntity , MutableHandleNameEntity When setting/adding a new custom data entity, MutableRawContact -> NewGender , NewHandleName NewRawContact -> NewGender , NewHandleName Setters for custom data with count restriction of AT_MOST_ONE should use setXXX for the function name. Setters for custom data with count restriction of NO_LIMIT should use addXXX and removeXXX for the function names. 9. Define Contact getters and setters \u00b6 Defining getters and setters for RawContacts is the bare minimum. However, if you want to add some convenience functions so that you can access RawContact getters and setters from a Contact, then you are free (and recommended) to do so. Due to the length of the ContactGender.kt and ContactHandleName.kt files, I will not be copy-pasting them here. Please take a look at those files instead. A few things to note, For getters, consider returning Sequence for optimizations in Kotlin. For setters, use the first RawContact (in case there are more than one). Consider returning Sequence for the getters for optimizations in Kotlin. Define getters and setters for Contact and MutableContact . Ensure to match the type of Contact with the type of the custom data. For example, Contact -> Gender , HandleName MutableContact -> MutableGenderEntity , MutableHandleNameEntity When setting/adding a new custom data entity, MutableContact -> NewGender , NewHandleName 10. Define exceptions \u00b6 Whether you are building this custom data just for your own app or for others to use, it is useful to define a subclass of CustomDataException to help identify errors in certain custom data integrations. For Gender , class GenderDataException ( message : String ) : CustomDataException ( message ) For HandleName , class HandleNameDataException ( message : String ) : CustomDataException ( message ) 11. Implement the field mapper \u00b6 A field mapper maps your custom data field to the corresponding property in your custom data entity. For Gender , internal class GenderFieldMapper : CustomDataFieldMapper < GenderField , GenderEntity > { override fun valueOf ( field : GenderField , customDataEntity : GenderEntity ): String? = when ( field ) { GenderFields . Type -> customDataEntity . type ?. ordinal ?. toString () GenderFields . Label -> customDataEntity . label else -> throw GenderDataException ( \"Unrecognized gender field $ field \" ) } } For HandleName , internal class HandleNameFieldMapper : CustomDataFieldMapper < HandleNameField , HandleNameEntity > { override fun valueOf ( field : HandleNameField , customDataEntity : HandleNameEntity ): String? = when ( field ) { HandleNameFields . Handle -> customDataEntity . handle else -> throw HandleNameDataException ( \"Unrecognized handle name field $ field \" ) } } A few things to note, You should throw an instance of your custom data exception in the case that there is no mapping from a field to a property. This ensures that your custom data integration will fail and fail-fast in case you forget to add a mapping to a property. 12. Define the data query function \u00b6 These (extension) functions on the DataQueryFactory allows you and your consumers to use the DataQuery API to specifically query for only your custom data kind instead of Contacts. For Gender , fun DataQueryFactory . genders (): DataQuery < GenderField , GenderFields , Gender > = customData ( GenderMimeType ) For HandleName , fun DataQueryFactory . handleNames (): DataQuery < HandleNameField , HandleNameFields , HandleName > = customData ( HandleNameMimeType ) For more info on the DataQuery API, read Query specific data kinds and Query custom data . 13. Define the custom data entry \u00b6 The entry puts everything together so that it can be handed off to the custom data registry to integrate your custom data with all of the APIs provided in the library. For Gender , internal class GenderEntry : Entry < GenderField , GenderDataCursor , GenderEntity , Gender > { override val mimeType = GenderMimeType override val fieldSet = GenderFields override val fieldMapper = GenderFieldMapper () override val countRestriction = GENDER_COUNT_RESTRICTION override val mapperFactory = GenderMapperFactory () override val operationFactory = GenderOperationFactory () } For HandleName , internal class HandleNameEntry : Entry < HandleNameField , HandleNameDataCursor , HandleNameEntity , HandleName > { override val mimeType = HandleNameMimeType override val fieldSet = HandleNameFields override val fieldMapper = HandleNameFieldMapper () override val countRestriction = HANDLE_NAME_COUNT_RESTRICTION override val mapperFactory = HandleNameMapperFactory () override val operationFactory = HandleNameOperationFactory () } 14. Define the custom data entry registration \u00b6 The entry registration provides a way for you to keep your Entry internal to your library module. \u2139\ufe0f In Java, the closest thing to this is package-private. This is not necessary to implement. Feel free to make your Entry public so that it can be handed off to the custom data registry. For Gender , class GenderRegistration : CustomDataRegistry . EntryRegistration { override fun registerTo ( customDataRegistry : CustomDataRegistry ) { customDataRegistry . register ( GenderEntry ()) } } For HandleName , class HandleNameRegistration : CustomDataRegistry . EntryRegistration { override fun registerTo ( customDataRegistry : CustomDataRegistry ) { customDataRegistry . register ( HandleNameEntry ()) } } 15. Register your custom data with the Contacts API instance \u00b6 There are two ways to register your custom data. Either using the entry registration defined in the previous step or the entry itself defined in the step prior. Using Gender and HandleName entry registration, val contactsApi = Contacts ( context , customDataRegistry = CustomDataRegistry (). register ( GenderRegistration (), HandleNameRegistration () ) ) Alternatively, val contactsApi = Contacts ( context ) GenderRegistration (). registerTo ( contactsApi . customDataRegistry ) HandleNameRegistration (). registerTo ( contactsApi . customDataRegistry ) Using Gender and HandleName entry, \u2139\ufe0f This is not possible with Gender and HandleName as their entries are internal. This is for demonstration purposes only. val contactsApi = Contacts ( context , customDataRegistry = CustomDataRegistry (). register ( GenderEntry (), HandleNameEntry () ) ) 16. Use your custom data in queries, inserts, updates, and deletes \u00b6 Once you have registered your custom data with the Contacts API instance, the API instance is now able to perform read and write operations on it. Query custom data Insert custom data into new or existing contacts Update custom data Delete custom data Consider adding your custom data to this library \u00b6 Let's say that you have created your own custom data in your own app. That's great and all but your app will be the only app that will be able to perform operations on it (unless the mimetype value you are using is also used by others). This is definitely something you want to do if you don't really want others to mess with your custom data (though you can't really stop others). If you want to add your custom data to this library so that other people using this library can optionally integrate it into their own apps, please create a GitHub issue and file a pull request! Custom data without sync adapters will not be synced \u00b6 Custom data provided by this library such as those in those in the customdata-gender , customdata-handlename , customdata-pokemon , and customdata-rpg modules are not synced because there are no sync adapters and a remote service to store those data. Therefore, they are not synced across devices and will remain local to the device regardless of Account sync settings. It is up to you to implement your own sync adapters for your own custom data. For more info, read Sync contact data across devices . Displaying your custom data in other Contacts apps \u00b6 If you want your custom data to be visible in the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) Contacts app (the default Contacts app that comes with a vanilla version of Android) and the Google Contacts app , then read this section. This is optional. If you only want your custom data to be visible in your application, then you should NOT do the things described in this part of the guide. \u2139\ufe0f The Google Contacts app keeps its \"File as\" custom data invisible to other Contacts apps such as the AOSP Contacts app. However, it exposes the \"Custom field+label\" custom data by doing the things described in this section. Important! The first criteria for being able to show your custom data in the Contacts app is to define and implement your own sync adapter. If you do not have a sync adapter implementation, your custom data will not be shown in the Contacts app! Again, this library does not provide any sync adapters. That is for you to implement based on your account services. This library provides you and users of your library an easy, uniform way to perform read and write operations on your custom data. The act of syncing is up to you. The official documentation on custom data rows is as follows, By creating and using your own custom MIME types, you can insert, edit, delete, and retrieve your own data rows in the ContactsContract.Data table. Your rows are limited to using the column defined in ContactsContract.DataColumns , although you can map your own type-specific column names to the default column names. In the device's contacts application, the data for your rows is displayed but can't be edited or deleted, and users can't add additional data. To allow users to modify your custom data rows, you must provide an editor activity in your own application. To display your custom data, provide a contacts.xml file containing a <ContactsAccountType> element and one or more of its <ContactsDataKind> child elements. This is described in more detail in the section <ContactsDataKind> element. Let's break down the official documentation. Contacts applications such as the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) Contacts app (the default Contacts app that comes with a vanilla version of Android) and the Google Contacts app (and other Contacts app that support this feature) shows custom data from other apps when viewing contact details. Custom data from other apps are viewable but not editable in order to preserve and respect the rules surrounding those custom data managed by other apps. This library allows you to read (query) and write (insert, update, delete) custom data from other apps. It is up to you whether you want to follow the same limitations imposed by the AOSP and Google Contacts app. In order to show your custom data in the AOSP Contacts app and Google Contacts app (and other Contacts app that support this feature), you must add an xml file in your app; res/xml/contacts.xml . The res/xml/contacts.xml template looks like this, <ContactsAccountType xmlns:android= \"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\" inviteContactActivity= \"activity_name\" inviteContactActionLabel= \"invite_command_text\" viewContactNotifyService= \"view_notify_service\" viewGroupActivity= \"group_view_activity\" viewGroupActionLabel= \"group_action_text\" viewStreamItemActivity= \"viewstream_activity_name\" viewStreamItemPhotoActivity= \"viewphotostream_activity_name\" > <ContactsDataKind android:mimeType= \"MIMEtype\" android:icon= \"icon_resources\" android:summaryColumn= \"column_name\" android:detailColumn= \"column_name\" /> </ContactsAccountType> The full official documentation for each of those tags and attributes within each tag are available by clicking this link . For example, the bare-minimum contacts.xml for showing Gender and HandleName custom data in the AOSP and Google Contacts app is the following, <ContactsAccountType xmlns:android= \"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\" > <!-- Gender --> <ContactsDataKind android:mimeType= \"vnd.android.cursor.item/contacts.entities.custom.gender\" android:summaryColumn= \"data2\" android:detailColumn= \"data3\" /> <!-- HandleName --> <ContactsDataKind android:mimeType= \"vnd.android.cursor.item/contacts.entities.custom.handlename\" android:summaryColumn= \"data1\" /> </ContactsAccountType> A few things to note, The value of android:mimeType corresponds to the String value defined in GenderMimeType and HandleNameMimeType as seen in the previous sections of this guide. The value of android:summaryColumn and android:detailColumn corresponds to the values defined in contacts.core.Fields.kt#AbstractCustomDataField.ColumnName that are used by GenderFields and HandleNameFields . These values, as raw strings, are; data1 , data2 , data3 ,... data15 Again, in order for your custom data to be shown in the Contacts app, you must also provide a sync adapter implementation. For more info, read Sync contact data across devices . Summary of limitations \u00b6 To reiterate, this library does not provide a remote server or sync adapters to interface with that server. This library provides create (insert), read (query), update, and delete (CRUD) APIs for pretty, type-safe, and well-documented read and write operations on all data kinds, including custom data. This means that if you do not implement your own sync adapter for your custom data, then your custom data... will NOT be synced across devices will NOT be shown in AOSP and Google Contacts apps, and other Contacts apps that show custom data from other apps You may still do creative things with custom data without sync adapters as long as you understand these limitations. This library provides CRUD API integration with custom data with no sync adapters; customdata-gender customdata-handlename customdata-pokemon customdata-rpg Also provided are CRUD API integration with custom data from other apps that do have sync adapters; customdata-googlecontacts \u2139\ufe0f Please update the above list whenever adding new custom data modules.","title":"Integrate custom data"},{"location":"customdata/integrate-custom-data/#integrate-custom-data","text":"If you are looking to integrate custom data from other apps, read Integrate custom data from other apps . If you are looking to create and integrate your own custom data, you are in the right place!

Providing sync adapters to sync custom data across devices. This library only handles the first part. If you want to sync your custom data, then you need to implement a sync adapter to interface with your remote server. That is out of scope of this library. In order to create and integrate your own custom data for use in your own apps, there is a bit of boilerplate code that needs to be written. Thankfully none of this stuff is difficult! Here are the steps, in chronological order, on how to define and use your own custom data, Define the mimetype Define the entities Define the fields Implement the cursor Implement the mapper Implement the operation Define the count restriction Define RawContact getters and setters Define Contact getters and setters Define exceptions Implement the field mapper Define the data query function Define the custom data entry Define the custom data entry registration Register your custom data with the Contacts API instance Use your custom data in queries, inserts, updates, and deletes \u2139\ufe0f Maybe someday someone with code generation experience (or I'll learn how to do it), will create annotations and annotation processors to eliminate having to manually write this stuff =) To help illustrate the above steps, we'll use the HandleName and Gender custom data provided in this library's customdata-handlename and customdata-gender respectively as an example. \u2139\ufe0f For more specifics on these custom data, read Integrate the gender custom data and Integrate the handle name custom data .

Old rows in the Data table will not be compatible if the mimetype value changes. You can certainly perform migrations by creating a new custom data altogether and migrating your old custom data to your new one. Do not use built-in mimetypes!

For more info, read Sync contact data across devices .","title":"Custom data without sync adapters will not be synced"},{"location":"customdata/integrate-custom-data/#displaying-your-custom-data-in-other-contacts-apps","text":"If you want your custom data to be visible in the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) Contacts app (the default Contacts app that comes with a vanilla version of Android) and the Google Contacts app , then read this section. This is optional. If you only want your custom data to be visible in your application, then you should NOT do the things described in this part of the guide. \u2139\ufe0f The Google Contacts app keeps its \"File as\" custom data invisible to other Contacts apps such as the AOSP Contacts app. However, it exposes the \"Custom field+label\" custom data by doing the things described in this section. Important! The first criteria for being able to show your custom data in the Contacts app is to define and implement your own sync adapter. If you do not have a sync adapter implementation, your custom data will not be shown in the Contacts app! Again, this library does not provide any sync adapters. That is for you to implement based on your account services. This library provides you and users of your library an easy, uniform way to perform read and write operations on your custom data. The act of syncing is up to you. The official documentation on custom data rows is as follows, By creating and using your own custom MIME types, you can insert, edit, delete, and retrieve your own data rows in the ContactsContract.Data table. Your rows are limited to using the column defined in ContactsContract.DataColumns , although you can map your own type-specific column names to the default column names. In the device's contacts application, the data for your rows is displayed but can't be edited or deleted, and users can't add additional data. To allow users to modify your custom data rows, you must provide an editor activity in your own application. To display your custom data, provide a contacts.xml file containing a <ContactsAccountType> element and one or more of its <ContactsDataKind> child elements. This is described in more detail in the section <ContactsDataKind> element. Let's break down the official documentation. Contacts applications such as the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) Contacts app (the default Contacts app that comes with a vanilla version of Android) and the Google Contacts app (and other Contacts app that support this feature) shows custom data from other apps when viewing contact details. Custom data from other apps are viewable but not editable in order to preserve and respect the rules surrounding those custom data managed by other apps. This library allows you to read (query) and write (insert, update, delete) custom data from other apps. It is up to you whether you want to follow the same limitations imposed by the AOSP and Google Contacts app. In order to show your custom data in the AOSP Contacts app and Google Contacts app (and other Contacts app that support this feature), you must add an xml file in your app; res/xml/contacts.xml . The res/xml/contacts.xml template looks like this, <ContactsAccountType xmlns:android= \"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\" inviteContactActivity= \"activity_name\" inviteContactActionLabel= \"invite_command_text\" viewContactNotifyService= \"view_notify_service\" viewGroupActivity= \"group_view_activity\" viewGroupActionLabel= \"group_action_text\" viewStreamItemActivity= \"viewstream_activity_name\" viewStreamItemPhotoActivity= \"viewphotostream_activity_name\" > <ContactsDataKind android:mimeType= \"MIMEtype\" android:icon= \"icon_resources\" android:summaryColumn= \"column_name\" android:detailColumn= \"column_name\" /> </ContactsAccountType> The full official documentation for each of those tags and attributes within each tag are available by clicking this link . For example, the bare-minimum contacts.xml for showing Gender and HandleName custom data in the AOSP and Google Contacts app is the following, <ContactsAccountType xmlns:android= \"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\" > <!-- Gender --> <ContactsDataKind android:mimeType= \"vnd.android.cursor.item/contacts.entities.custom.gender\" android:summaryColumn= \"data2\" android:detailColumn= \"data3\" /> <!-- HandleName --> <ContactsDataKind android:mimeType= \"vnd.android.cursor.item/contacts.entities.custom.handlename\" android:summaryColumn= \"data1\" /> </ContactsAccountType> A few things to note, The value of android:mimeType corresponds to the String value defined in GenderMimeType and HandleNameMimeType as seen in the previous sections of this guide. The value of android:summaryColumn and android:detailColumn corresponds to the values defined in contacts.core.Fields.kt#AbstractCustomDataField.ColumnName that are used by GenderFields and HandleNameFields . These values, as raw strings, are; data1 , data2 , data3 ,... data15 Again, in order for your custom data to be shown in the Contacts app, you must also provide a sync adapter implementation.

Afterwards, everything in this library should just make sense. There is only one thing you need to know outside of this library. The library handles the rest of the details so you don't have to! Contacts Provider / ContactsContract Basic Concept \u00b6 There are 3 main database tables used in dealing with contacts. These tables are all connected. Contacts Rows representing different people. E.G. John Doe RawContacts Rows that link Contacts rows to specific Accounts. E.G. John Doe from john.doe@gmail.com, John Doe from john.dow@hotmail.com Data Rows containing data (e.g. name, email) for a RawContacts row. E.G. John Doe from Gmail's name and email, John Doe from Hotmail's phone and address \u2139\ufe0f There are more tables but it won't be covered in this docs for brevity. In the example given (E.G.) above, there is one row in the Contacts table for the person John Doe there are 2 rows in the RawContacts table that make up the Contact John Doe there are 4 rows in the Data table belonging to the Contact John Doe. 2 of these rows belong to John Doe from Gmail and the other 2 belong to John Doe from Hotmail In the background, the Contacts Provider automatically performs the RawContacts linking/aggregation into a single Contact. To forcefully link or unlink sets of RawContacts, read Link unlink Contacts . In the background, the Contacts Provider syncs all data from the local database to the remote database and vice versa (depending on system contact sync settings). Read more in Sync contact data across devices . That's all you need to know! Hopefully it wasn't too much. I know it was difficult for me to grasp in the beginning =P. Once you internalize this one to many relationship between Contacts -> RawContacts -> Data , you have unlocked the full potential of this library and the world is at the palm of your hands ! Contacts API Entities \u00b6 This library provides entities that model everything in the Contacts Provider database. Contact Primarily contains a list of RawContacts that are associated with this contact. RawContact Contains contact data that belong to an account. There may be more than one RawContact per Contact. DataEntity A specific kind of data of a RawContact. These entities model the common data kinds that are provided by the Contacts Provider. Address Email Event GroupMembership Im Name Nickname Note Organization Phone Photo Relation SipAddress Website You can find all of the above in the contacts.core.entities package. Note that there are other entities that are not mentioned in this docs for brevity. All entities are Parcelable to support state retention during app/activity/fragment/view recreation. Each entity has an immutable version (typically returned by queries) and a mutable version (typically used by insert, update, and delete functions). Most immutable entities have a mutableCopy function that returns a mutable copy (typically to be used for inserts and updates and other mutating API functions). \u2139\ufe0f Custom data kinds may also be integrated into the contacts database (though not synced across devices). For more info, read Integrate custom data . \u2139\ufe0f Default native and custom data may be retrieved, set, or cleared. For more info, read Get set clear default Contact data . Contacts API Fields \u00b6 The fields defined in contacts.core.Fields.kt specify what properties of entities to include in read and write operations. For example, to include only the contact display name, organization company, and all phone number fields in a query/insert/update operation, queryInsertUpdate . include ( mutableSetOf < AbstractDataField > (). apply { add ( Fields . Contact . DisplayNamePrimary ) add ( Fields . Organization . Company ) addAll ( Fields . Phone . all ) }) The following entity properties are are used in the read/write operation, Contact { displayNamePrimary RawContact { organization { company } phones { number normalizedNumber type label } } } \u2139\ufe0f For more info, read Include only certain fields for read and write operations . Data kinds count restrictions \u00b6 A RawContact may have at most one OR no limits of certain kinds of data. A RawContact may have 0 or 1 of each of these data kinds; Name Nickname Note Organization Photo SipAddress A RawContact may have 0, 1, or more of each of these data kinds; Address Email Event GroupMembership Im Phone Relation Website The Contacts Provider may or may not enforce these count restrictions. However, the native Contacts app imposes these restrictions. Therefore, this library also imposes these restrictions and disables consumers from violating them. The core library does not explicitly expose count restrictions to consumers. However, it is exposed when integrating custom data via the CustomDataCountRestriction . Read-only data \u00b6 Any data kind may be set as read-only during insertion of new RawContacts. This is not for general application usage and should really only be used by sync adapters. For example, NewEmail ( address = \"read.only@read.com\" , isReadOnly = true ) \u2139\ufe0f For more info, read the in-code documentation of NewDataEntity.isReadOnly . To set the read-only property of all data of a NewRawContact in one function call, newRawContact . setDataAsReadOnly ( true ) Checking if an ExistingDataEntity is read-only requires a separate query. You can use extension functions defined in DataIsReadOnly.kt for this purpose. \u2139\ufe0f For more info, read Convenience functions | Check if Data is read-only . Modifying read-only data locally as a sync adapter is possible by using an instance of contacts.core.Contacts with the callerIsSyncAdapter flag set to true. \u2139\ufe0f For more info, read Contacts API Setup | Sync adapter operations . Data integrity \u00b6 There is a section in the official Contacts Provider documentation about \"Data Integrity\"; https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/contacts-provider#DataIntegrity It enumerates four general rules to follow to retain the \"integrity of data\" :D Paraphrasing in terms of this library, the rules are as follows; Always add a Name for every RawContact . Always link new Data to their parent RawContact . Change data only for those raw contacts that you own. Always use the constants defined in ContactsContract and its subclasses for authorities, content URIs, URI paths, column names, MIME types, and TYPE values. This library follows rules 2 and 4. Rule 1 is ignored because the native Contacts app also ignores that rule. Enforcing this rule means that a name has to be provided for every RawContact , which is not practical at all. Users should be able to create contacts with just an email or phone number, without a name. This library follows the native Contacts app behavior, which also disregards this rule =P Rule 3 is intentionally ignored. There are two kinds of data; a. those that are defined in the Contacts Provider (e.g. name, email, phone number, etc) b. those that are defined by other apps (e.g. custom data from other apps) This library allows modification of native data kinds and custom data kinds. Native data kinds should obviously be modifiable as it is the entire reason why the Contacts Provider exposes these data kinds to us in the first place. The question is, should this library provide functions for modifying (insert, update, delete) custom data defined by other apps/services (e.g. Google Contacts, WhatsApp, etc)? The answer to that will be determined when the time comes to support custom data from other apps in the future... Probably, yes! For more info, read Integrate custom data from other apps . Accessing contact data \u00b6 When you have an instance of Contact , you have complete access to data stored in it. To access data of a Contact with only one RawContact, val contact : Contact val rawContact : RawContact = contact . rawContacts . first () Log . d ( \"Contact\" , \"\"\" ID: ${ contact . id } Lookup Key: ${ contact . lookupKey } Display name: ${ contact . displayNamePrimary } Display name alt: ${ contact . displayNameAlt } Photo Uri: ${ contact . photoUri } Thumbnail Uri: ${ contact . photoThumbnailUri } Last updated: ${ contact . lastUpdatedTimestamp } Starred?: ${ contact . options ?. starred } Send to voicemail?: ${ contact . options ?. sendToVoicemail } Ringtone: ${ contact . options ?. customRingtone } Addresses: ${ rawContact . addresses } Emails: ${ rawContact . emails } Events: ${ rawContact . events } Group memberships: ${ rawContact . groupMemberships } IMs: ${ rawContact . ims } Name: ${ rawContact . name } Nickname: ${ rawContact . nickname } Note: ${ rawContact . note } Organization: ${ rawContact . organization } Phones: ${ rawContact . phones } Relations: ${ rawContact . relations } SipAddress: ${ rawContact . sipAddress } Websites: ${ rawContact . websites } \"\"\" . trimIndent () // Photo require separate blocking function calls. ) To access data of a Contact with possibly more than one RawContact, we can use ContactData.kt extensions to make our life easier, val contact : Contact Log . d ( \"Contact\" , \"\"\" ID: ${ contact . id } Lookup Key: ${ contact . lookupKey } Display name: ${ contact . displayNamePrimary } Display name alt: ${ contact . displayNameAlt } Photo Uri: ${ contact . photoUri } Thumbnail Uri: ${ contact . photoThumbnailUri } Last updated: ${ contact . lastUpdatedTimestamp } Starred?: ${ contact . options ?. starred } Send to voicemail?: ${ contact . options ?. sendToVoicemail } Ringtone: ${ contact . options ?. customRingtone } Aggregate data from all RawContacts of the contact ----------------------------------- Addresses: ${ contact . addressList () } Emails: ${ contact . emailList () } Events: ${ contact . eventList () } Group memberships: ${ contact . groupMembershipList () } IMs: ${ contact . imList () } Names: ${ contact . nameList () } Nicknames: ${ contact . nicknameList () } Notes: ${ contact . noteList () } Organizations: ${ contact . organizationList () } Phones: ${ contact . phoneList () } Relations: ${ contact . relationList () } SipAddresses: ${ contact . sipAddressList () } Websites: ${ contact . websiteList () } ----------------------------------- \"\"\" . trimIndent () // There are also aggregate data functions that return a sequence instead of a list. ) Each Contact may have more than one of the following data if the Contact is made up of 2 or more RawContacts; name, nickname, note, organization, sip address.

Redacting entities \u00b6 All Entity in this library are Redactable , which indicates that there could be sensitive private user data that could be redacted, for legal purposes. If you are logging contact data in production to remote data centers for analytics or crash reporting, then it is important to redact certain parts of every contact's data. For more info, read Redact entities and API input and output in production . Syncing contact data \u00b6 Syncing contact data, including groups, are done automatically by the Contacts Provider depending on the account sync settings. For more info, read Sync contact data across devices . Developer notes (or for advanced users) \u00b6 Automatic data kinds creation \u00b6 An entry of each of the following data kinds are automatically created for all contacts, if not provided; GroupMembership , underlying value defaults to the account's default system group Name , underlying value defaults to null Nickname , underlying value defaults to null Note , underlying value defaults to null This automatic creation occur automatically in the background (typically after creation) only for RawContacts that are associated with an Account. If a valid account is provided, membership to the (auto add) system group is automatically created immediately by the Contacts Provider at the time of creation. The name, nickname, and note are automatically created at a later time. \u2139\ufe0f Query APIs in this library do not return blanks in results. In this case, the Name , Nickname , and Note will not be included in the RawContact because their primary values are all null. Blanks are also ignored on insert and deleted on update.

The official documentation for the Contact lookup key is, \u2139\ufe0f An opaque value that contains hints on how to find the contact if its row id changed as a result of a sync or aggregation. Let's dissect the documentation, \"if its row id changed\". This means that a Person's row ID can change! \"as a result of a sync\". The Contacts Provider allows sync adapters to modify the local and remote Contacts databases to ensure that Contact data is synced per user account. \"as a result of...aggregation\". Two or more Contacts (along with their constituent RawContacts) can be linked into a single Contact. When this happens, those Contacts will be consolidated into a single (existing) Contact row. Unlinking will result in the original Contacts prior to linking to have different IDs in the Contacts table because the previously deleted row IDs cannot be reused. Unlike the Contact ID, the lookup key's components (it can be more than one if there are more than one constituent RawContact) is the same across devices (for contacts that are associated with an Account and are synced). The lookup key points to a person entity rather than just a row in a table. It is the unique identifier used by local and remote sync adapters to identify an aggregate contact. \u2139\ufe0f Actually, it seems like the Contact lookup key is a reference to a RawContact (or all of its constituent RawContacts). RawContacts have a reference to the parent Contact via the Contact ID. Similarly, the parent Contact has a reference to all of its constituent RawContacts via the lookup key. Note that RawContacts do not have a lookup key. It is exclusive to Contacts. However, RawContacts associated with an Account that have a SyncAdapter typically have a non-null value in the ContactsContract.SyncColumns.SOURCE_ID column, which is typically used as a component in the parent Contact's lookup key. \u26a0\ufe0fSetting the RawContact's SOURCE_ID to a different value will change the lookup key of the parent Contact, which may break existing shortcuts! When to use Contact lookup key vs Contact ID? \u00b6 Use the Contact lookup key when you need to save a reference to a Contact that you want to fetch after some period of time. Saving/restoring activity/fragment instance state. Saving to an external database, preferences, or files. Creating shortcuts. Use the Contact ID for everything else. Performing read/write operations in the same function call or session in your app. Performing read/write operations that require ID (e.g. Contact photo and options). How to get the Contact lookup key? \u00b6 Lookup keys are included in queries by default but are not required. This means that if you use do not invoke the include function in query APIs, then it will be included in the returned Contacts. However, if you do specify fields to include by invoking the include function, then you must explicitly specify the lookup key, . include ( Fields . Contact . LookupKey ) Contact s instances returned by the query will contain a value in the Contact.lookupKey property. For more info, read Include only certain fields for read and write operations .

LookupKey contains it } }. find () Or use the lookupKeyIn extensions in contacts.core.util.ContactLookupKey.kt to get contacts by lookup key, val contacts = query . where { Contact . lookupKeyIn ( lookupKeys ) }. find () For an explanation on why you should use those functions instead of the lookup key directly, read the function documentation. Note that if the lookup key is a reference to a linked Contact (a Contact with two or more constituent RawContacts), and the linked Contact is unlinked, then the query will return multiple Contacts. \u2139\ufe0f For more info, read Query contacts (advanced) . Moving RawContacts between accounts and the lookup key \u00b6 Moving a RawContact to a different Account will cause the Contact lookup key to change. In these cases, the changes to the lookup key will only be applied after the Contacts Provider and sync adapters sync the changes. This means that the local changes are not immediately applied. \u2139\ufe0f For more info, read Sync contact data across devices . Moving a RawContact from one Account to another will result in a failed query using lookup keys. For example, using the default AOSP Contacts app or the Google Contacts app... View a contact's details. Create a shortcut to it in the home screen (launcher). This shortcut uses the Contact lookup key (not the ID) to form a lookup URI. Move the RawContact to a different Account. Tap the shortcut in the home screen (launcher). Both Contacts apps will say that the Contact no longer exist or has been removed. This is not a bug. It is expected behavior due to the way the Contacts Provider works. \u2139\ufe0f For more info, read Move RawContacts across Accounts . Linking/unlinking contacts and the lookup key \u00b6 Linking and unlinking RawContacts will change the value of the lookup key. However, as discussed in prior sections, you are still able to use the lookup key to find the aggregate Contact even though the Contact ID has changed. Linking/unlinking contacts will result in a successful lookup using lookup keys prior to the Account change. For example, using the default AOSP Contacts app or the Google Contacts app... View a contact's details. Create a shortcut to it in the home screen (launcher). This shortcut uses the Contact lookup key (not the ID) to form a lookup URI. Link the contact to another contact. Tap the shortcut in the home screen (launcher). Unlink the contact. Tap the shortcut in the home screen (launcher). In both cases, the shortcut successfully opens the correct aggregate Contact. \u2139\ufe0f For more info on linking/unlinking, read Link unlink Contacts . Developer notes (or for advanced users) \u00b6 \u2139\ufe0f The following section are note from developers of this library for other developers. It is copied from the DEV_NOTES . You may still read the following as a consumer of the library in case you need deeper insight. The Contacts._ID is the unique identifier for the row in the Contacts table. The Contacts.LOOKUP_KEY is the unique identifier for an aggregate Contact (a person). The _ID may change due to aggregation and sync. The same goes for the LOOKUP_KEY but unlike the ID it may still be used to find the aggregate contact. Unlike the Contact ID, the lookup key is the same across devices (for contacts that are associated with an Account and are synced). \u2139\ufe0f The following investigation was done with a much larger data set. I has been simplified here for brevity. Let's take a look at the following Contacts and RawContacts table rows, #### Contacts table Contact id: 55, lookupKey: 0r55-2E4644502A2E50563A503840462E2A404C2A562E4644502A2E50, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Local RawContact Contact id: 56, lookupKey: 2059i6f5de8460f7f227e, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Synced RawContact #### RawContacts table RawContact id: 55, contactId: 55, sourceId: null, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Local RawContact RawContact id: 56, contactId: 56, sourceId: 2059i6f5de8460f7f227e, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Synced RawContact There are two Contacts each having one RawContact. Notice that the lookup keys are a bit different. Contact With Local RawContact: 0r55-2E4644502A2E50563A503840462E2A404C2A562E4644502A2E50 Contact With Synced RawContact: 2059i6f5de8460f7f227e The Contact with synced RawContact uses te RawContact's SOURCE_ID as part of its lookup key. The Contact with unsynced, device-only, local RawContact has a much longer (or shorter e.g. 0r62-2A2C2E) lookup key and starts with \"0r -\" and all characters after it are in uppercase. The other thing to notice is that the \"55\" in \"0r55-\" seems to be the same as the RawContact ID (I did a bit more experiments than what is written in these notes to confirm that it is indeed the RawContact ID and not the Contact ID). We probably don't need to worry about these details though the Contacts Provider probably uses these things internally. We also should not rely on it. In any case, it is safe to assume that the Contact lookup key is a reference to a RawContact (or reference to more than one constituent RawContact when multiple RawContacts are linked). Again, an internal Contacts Provider detail we should not rely on BUT is probably relevant when implementing sync adapters. When we link the two, we get... Contact id: 55, lookupKey: 0r55-2E4644502A2E50563A503840462E2A404C2A562E4644502A2E50.2059i6f5de8460f7f227e, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Synced RawContact #### RawContacts table RawContact id: 55, contactId: 55, sorceId: null, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Local RawContact RawContact id: 56, contactId: 55, sourceId: 6f5de8460f7f227e, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Synced RawContact Notice, Contact with ID 56 has been deleted. Contact with ID 55 still exist with the lookup keys of both Contact 55 and 56 combined separated by a \".\" . This holds true in cases where two or more local-only or non-local-only RawContacts are linked. RawContacts remain unchanged except reference to Contact 56 has been replaced with 55. The primary display name of Contact 55 came from RawContact 55 prior to the link and now comes from RawContact 56 after the link. This primary name resolution is probably irrelevant so pay no attention to it. The most important part to notice is that the lookup keys get combined. The lookup uri is required to build a Contacts.CONTENT_LOOKUP_URI ... /** * A content:// style URI for this table that should be used to create * shortcuts or otherwise create long-term links to contacts. This URI * should always be followed by a \"/\" and the contact's {@link #LOOKUP_KEY}. * It can optionally also have a \"/\" and last known contact ID appended after * that. This \"complete\" format is an important optimization and is highly recommended. * <p> * As long as the contact's row ID remains the same, this URI is * equivalent to {@link #CONTENT_URI}. If the contact's row ID changes * as a result of a sync or aggregation, this URI will look up the * contact using indirect information (sync IDs or constituent raw * contacts). * <p> * Lookup key should be appended unencoded - it is stored in the encoded * form, ready for use in a URI. */ public static final Uri CONTENT_LOOKUP_URI = Uri . withAppendedPath ( CONTENT_URI , \"lookup\" ); /** * Build a {@link #CONTENT_LOOKUP_URI} lookup {@link Uri} using the * given {@link ContactsContract.Contacts#_ID} and {@link #LOOKUP_KEY}. * <p> * Returns null if unable to construct a valid lookup URI from the * provided parameters. */ public static Uri getLookupUri ( long contactId , String lookupKey ) { if ( TextUtils . isEmpty ( lookupKey )) { return null ; } return ContentUris . withAppendedId ( Uri . withAppendedPath ( Contacts . CONTENT_LOOKUP_URI , lookupKey ), contactId ); } From the lookup uri, we can lookup the Contact row... public static Uri lookupContact ( ContentResolver resolver , Uri lookupUri ) { ... } Or simply get the Contact ID... // code inside `public static Uri lookupContact` resolver . query ( lookupUri , new String [] { Contacts . _ID }, null , null , null ) However, given that the lookup key of the deleted Contact 56 still lives on, it is possible to get the linked Contact 55 using the lookup key of Contact 56 using our standard query APIs! . where { Contact . LookupKey contains lookupKey } The above is correct as long as these assumptions hold true; the lookup key is unique there is no lookup key that can contain a shorter lookup key the Contact ID fails this test because a smaller number is contained in a larger number synced contacts have shorter lookup keys than local contacts. However, local contacts' lookup keys are capitalized whereas synced contact are not. Also, there seems to be other differences in pattern between long and short lookup keys. It should be safe to make this assumption. Until the community finds that this assumption is flawed, we'll assume that it is true! For now, we can avoid having to create another API or extensions just for using lookup keys . When we unlink , we get... #### Contacts table Contact id: 55, lookupKey: 2059i6f5de8460f7f227e, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Synced RawContact Contact id: 58, lookupKey: 0r55-2E4644502A2E50563A503840462E2A404C2A562E4644502A2E50, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Local RawContact #### RawContacts table RawContact id: 55, contactId: 58, sourceId: null, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Local RawContact RawContact id: 56, contactId: 55, sourceId: 6f5de8460f7f227e, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Synced RawContact Notice, A new Contact row with ID of 58 is created. The lookup keys are separated and distributed between Contact 55 and 58. RawContact 55 Contact reference has been set to Contact 58. Let's compare the Contact-RawContact relationship before and after linking and then unlinking. Contact ID Lookup Key RawContact.Contact ID Before 55, 56 0r55-2E4644502A2E50563A503840462E2A404C2A562E4644502A2E50, 2059i6f5de8460f7f227e 55, 56 After 55, 58 2059i6f5de8460f7f227e, 0r55-2E4644502A2E50563A503840462E2A404C2A562E4644502A2E50 58, 55 Notice, Contact ID 55 swapped lookup keys with the former Contact 56 (now 58). RawContact ID 55 swapped Contact reference with RawContact 56. The Contact IDs and lookup keys got shuffled BUT the Contact-RawContact relationship remains the same if using the lookup keys as point of reference! Here is another way to look at the table, using the lookup key as the constant... Lookup Key Before After 0r55-2E4644502A2E50563A503840462E2A404C2A562E4644502A2E50 Contact 55, RawContact 55 Contact 58, RawContact 55 2059i6f5de8460f7f227e Contact 56, RawContact 56 Contact 55, RawContact 56 Notice that the indirect relationship between the lookup key and RawContacts remains the same before and after the link-unlink even though the Contact IDs changed. \u2139\ufe0f As mentioned earlier in this section, the \"55\" in \"0r55-\" seems to be referencing the RawContact ID. In other words, since local RawContacts are not synced or tracked in a remote database where Contacts -> RawContacts mappings exist, the Contacts Provider most likely uses this \"0r -\" pattern to make the connection. This is not really relevant for us as we are not relying on this mechanism. I'm just pointing out my observations, which could be incorrect. This means that... If users of this library saved a reference Contact ID 55, then a link-unlink (or sync adapter functions) occur. Getting Contact by ID 55 will result in the RawContact-Data of the former Contact 56 to be returned. This is a bug! Same goes if users saved a reference to Contact ID 56. If users of this library saved a reference to the lookup keys, then a link-unlink (or sync adapter functions) occur. Getting Contact by lookup key will result in the correct RawContact-Data to be returned. So when to use Contact ID vs lookup key? Lookup key: for a reference to a Contact that needs to be loaded after some period of time. Saving/restoring activity/fragment instance state. Saving to an external database, preferences, or files. Creating shortcuts. ID: for everything else. Performing read/write operations in the same function call or session in your app. Performing read/write operations that require ID (e.g. Contact photo and options). Another thing to check is what happens when associating a local RawContact to an Account (move from device to Account) and vice versa. Is the lookup key of the Contact affected? After associating the local RawContact to an Account... #### Contacts table Contact id: 58, lookupKey: 2059i4abd4a8f8ff89642 #### RawContacts table RawContact id: 55, contactId: 58, sourceId: 4abd4a8f8ff89642 The lookup key changed (since the RawContact's source ID has been assigned the value that came from the sync adapter) but the Contact ID remained the same! In this case, loading a reference to the previously local Contact will fail! I verified that this is indeed the behavior of the native (AOSP) Contacts app. Moving the RawContact from device to Google using Google Contacts app while having Contact details activity opened in the AOSP Contacts app will result in \"error Contact does not exist\" message in the AOSP Contacts app! \u2139\ufe0f The RawContact and its Data also remained the same in this case. Removing the account from it results in... #### Contacts table Contact id: 59, lookupKey: 0r58-2E4644502A2E50563A503840462E2A404C2A562E4644502A2E50 #### RawContacts table RawContact id: 58, contactId: 59, sourceId: null The Contact and RawContacts row have been deleted and new rows have been created to replace them! I also verified that the Data rows have also been deleted and new rows have been created to replace them!

It is copied from the DEV_NOTES . You may still read the following as a consumer of the library in case you need deeper insight. The Contacts._ID is the unique identifier for the row in the Contacts table. The Contacts.LOOKUP_KEY is the unique identifier for an aggregate Contact (a person). The _ID may change due to aggregation and sync. The same goes for the LOOKUP_KEY but unlike the ID it may still be used to find the aggregate contact. Unlike the Contact ID, the lookup key is the same across devices (for contacts that are associated with an Account and are synced). \u2139\ufe0f The following investigation was done with a much larger data set. I has been simplified here for brevity. Let's take a look at the following Contacts and RawContacts table rows, #### Contacts table Contact id: 55, lookupKey: 0r55-2E4644502A2E50563A503840462E2A404C2A562E4644502A2E50, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Local RawContact Contact id: 56, lookupKey: 2059i6f5de8460f7f227e, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Synced RawContact #### RawContacts table RawContact id: 55, contactId: 55, sourceId: null, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Local RawContact RawContact id: 56, contactId: 56, sourceId: 2059i6f5de8460f7f227e, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Synced RawContact There are two Contacts each having one RawContact. Notice that the lookup keys are a bit different. Contact With Local RawContact: 0r55-2E4644502A2E50563A503840462E2A404C2A562E4644502A2E50 Contact With Synced RawContact: 2059i6f5de8460f7f227e The Contact with synced RawContact uses te RawContact's SOURCE_ID as part of its lookup key. The Contact with unsynced, device-only, local RawContact has a much longer (or shorter e.g. 0r62-2A2C2E) lookup key and starts with \"0r -\" and all characters after it are in uppercase. The other thing to notice is that the \"55\" in \"0r55-\" seems to be the same as the RawContact ID (I did a bit more experiments than what is written in these notes to confirm that it is indeed the RawContact ID and not the Contact ID). We probably don't need to worry about these details though the Contacts Provider probably uses these things internally. We also should not rely on it. In any case, it is safe to assume that the Contact lookup key is a reference to a RawContact (or reference to more than one constituent RawContact when multiple RawContacts are linked). Again, an internal Contacts Provider detail we should not rely on BUT is probably relevant when implementing sync adapters. When we link the two, we get... Contact id: 55, lookupKey: 0r55-2E4644502A2E50563A503840462E2A404C2A562E4644502A2E50.2059i6f5de8460f7f227e, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Synced RawContact #### RawContacts table RawContact id: 55, contactId: 55, sorceId: null, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Local RawContact RawContact id: 56, contactId: 55, sourceId: 6f5de8460f7f227e, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Synced RawContact Notice, Contact with ID 56 has been deleted. Contact with ID 55 still exist with the lookup keys of both Contact 55 and 56 combined separated by a \".\" . This holds true in cases where two or more local-only or non-local-only RawContacts are linked. RawContacts remain unchanged except reference to Contact 56 has been replaced with 55. The primary display name of Contact 55 came from RawContact 55 prior to the link and now comes from RawContact 56 after the link. This primary name resolution is probably irrelevant so pay no attention to it. The most important part to notice is that the lookup keys get combined. The lookup uri is required to build a Contacts.CONTENT_LOOKUP_URI ... /** * A content:// style URI for this table that should be used to create * shortcuts or otherwise create long-term links to contacts. This URI * should always be followed by a \"/\" and the contact's {@link #LOOKUP_KEY}. * It can optionally also have a \"/\" and last known contact ID appended after * that. This \"complete\" format is an important optimization and is highly recommended. * <p> * As long as the contact's row ID remains the same, this URI is * equivalent to {@link #CONTENT_URI}. If the contact's row ID changes * as a result of a sync or aggregation, this URI will look up the * contact using indirect information (sync IDs or constituent raw * contacts). * <p> * Lookup key should be appended unencoded - it is stored in the encoded * form, ready for use in a URI. */ public static final Uri CONTENT_LOOKUP_URI = Uri . withAppendedPath ( CONTENT_URI , \"lookup\" ); /** * Build a {@link #CONTENT_LOOKUP_URI} lookup {@link Uri} using the * given {@link ContactsContract.Contacts#_ID} and {@link #LOOKUP_KEY}. * <p> * Returns null if unable to construct a valid lookup URI from the * provided parameters. */ public static Uri getLookupUri ( long contactId , String lookupKey ) { if ( TextUtils . isEmpty ( lookupKey )) { return null ; } return ContentUris . withAppendedId ( Uri . withAppendedPath ( Contacts . CONTENT_LOOKUP_URI , lookupKey ), contactId ); } From the lookup uri, we can lookup the Contact row... public static Uri lookupContact ( ContentResolver resolver , Uri lookupUri ) { ... } Or simply get the Contact ID... // code inside `public static Uri lookupContact` resolver . query ( lookupUri , new String [] { Contacts . _ID }, null , null , null ) However, given that the lookup key of the deleted Contact 56 still lives on, it is possible to get the linked Contact 55 using the lookup key of Contact 56 using our standard query APIs! . where { Contact . LookupKey contains lookupKey } The above is correct as long as these assumptions hold true; the lookup key is unique there is no lookup key that can contain a shorter lookup key the Contact ID fails this test because a smaller number is contained in a larger number synced contacts have shorter lookup keys than local contacts. However, local contacts' lookup keys are capitalized whereas synced contact are not. Also, there seems to be other differences in pattern between long and short lookup keys. It should be safe to make this assumption. Until the community finds that this assumption is flawed, we'll assume that it is true! For now, we can avoid having to create another API or extensions just for using lookup keys . When we unlink , we get... #### Contacts table Contact id: 55, lookupKey: 2059i6f5de8460f7f227e, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Synced RawContact Contact id: 58, lookupKey: 0r55-2E4644502A2E50563A503840462E2A404C2A562E4644502A2E50, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Local RawContact #### RawContacts table RawContact id: 55, contactId: 58, sourceId: null, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Local RawContact RawContact id: 56, contactId: 55, sourceId: 6f5de8460f7f227e, displayNamePrimary: Contact With Synced RawContact Notice, A new Contact row with ID of 58 is created. The lookup keys are separated and distributed between Contact 55 and 58. RawContact 55 Contact reference has been set to Contact 58. Let's compare the Contact-RawContact relationship before and after linking and then unlinking. Contact ID Lookup Key RawContact.Contact ID Before 55, 56 0r55-2E4644502A2E50563A503840462E2A404C2A562E4644502A2E50, 2059i6f5de8460f7f227e 55, 56 After 55, 58 2059i6f5de8460f7f227e, 0r55-2E4644502A2E50563A503840462E2A404C2A562E4644502A2E50 58, 55 Notice, Contact ID 55 swapped lookup keys with the former Contact 56 (now 58). RawContact ID 55 swapped Contact reference with RawContact 56. The Contact IDs and lookup keys got shuffled BUT the Contact-RawContact relationship remains the same if using the lookup keys as point of reference! Here is another way to look at the table, using the lookup key as the constant... Lookup Key Before After 0r55-2E4644502A2E50563A503840462E2A404C2A562E4644502A2E50 Contact 55, RawContact 55 Contact 58, RawContact 55 2059i6f5de8460f7f227e Contact 56, RawContact 56 Contact 55, RawContact 56 Notice that the indirect relationship between the lookup key and RawContacts remains the same before and after the link-unlink even though the Contact IDs changed. \u2139\ufe0f As mentioned earlier in this section, the \"55\" in \"0r55-\" seems to be referencing the RawContact ID. In other words, since local RawContacts are not synced or tracked in a remote database where Contacts -> RawContacts mappings exist, the Contacts Provider most likely uses this \"0r -\" pattern to make the connection. This is not really relevant for us as we are not relying on this mechanism. I'm just pointing out my observations, which could be incorrect. This means that... If users of this library saved a reference Contact ID 55, then a link-unlink (or sync adapter functions) occur. Getting Contact by ID 55 will result in the RawContact-Data of the former Contact 56 to be returned. This is a bug! Same goes if users saved a reference to Contact ID 56. If users of this library saved a reference to the lookup keys, then a link-unlink (or sync adapter functions) occur. Getting Contact by lookup key will result in the correct RawContact-Data to be returned. So when to use Contact ID vs lookup key? Lookup key: for a reference to a Contact that needs to be loaded after some period of time. Saving/restoring activity/fragment instance state. Saving to an external database, preferences, or files. Creating shortcuts. ID: for everything else. Performing read/write operations in the same function call or session in your app. Performing read/write operations that require ID (e.g. Contact photo and options). Another thing to check is what happens when associating a local RawContact to an Account (move from device to Account) and vice versa. Is the lookup key of the Contact affected? After associating the local RawContact to an Account... #### Contacts table Contact id: 58, lookupKey: 2059i4abd4a8f8ff89642 #### RawContacts table RawContact id: 55, contactId: 58, sourceId: 4abd4a8f8ff89642 The lookup key changed (since the RawContact's source ID has been assigned the value that came from the sync adapter) but the Contact ID remained the same! In this case, loading a reference to the previously local Contact will fail! I verified that this is indeed the behavior of the native (AOSP) Contacts app. Moving the RawContact from device to Google using Google Contacts app while having Contact details activity opened in the AOSP Contacts app will result in \"error Contact does not exist\" message in the AOSP Contacts app! \u2139\ufe0f The RawContact and its Data also remained the same in this case. Removing the account from it results in... #### Contacts table Contact id: 59, lookupKey: 0r58-2E4644502A2E50563A503840462E2A404C2A562E4644502A2E50 #### RawContacts table RawContact id: 58, contactId: 59, sourceId: null The Contact and RawContacts row have been deleted and new rows have been created to replace them! I also verified that the Data rows have also been deleted and new rows have been created to replace them! This stuff is not really relevant for lookup key but still good to know for implementing moving RawContacts between accounts.","title":"Developer notes (or for advanced users)"},{"location":"entities/about-local-contacts/","text":"Local (device-only) contacts \u00b6 Contacts, or more specifically RawContacts, that are not associated with an android.accounts.Account are local to each device and will not be synced across devices.

You can typically find these account sync settings via Settings -> Accounts -> -> Account sync -> \"Contacts\" . Of course, in addition to having Contacts syncing enabled in settings, you must also have network connection to sync between the device and remote servers. When you have Contacts syncing enabled, as long as the android.accounts.Account has active sync adapters and remote services and you have network connection, data belonging to that account (e.g. \"vestrel00@gmail.com\" is a Google account) are synced across devices and online. This means that any contacts you create, update, or delete will be synced on all devices and services associated with that account. \u2139\ufe0f Besides Google Accounts, there is also Samsung, Xiaomi, Yahoo, MSN/Hotmail, etc. Syncing contacts across devices is possible with sync adapters and Contacts' lookup key, more specifically the RawContact's source ID. \u2139\ufe0f For more info, read about Contact lookup key vs ID . Adding or removing Accounts \u00b6 When an Account is added to the system and Contacts syncing is enabled and there is network connection, the Contacts Provider will automatically fetch all Contacts, RawContacts, Data, and Groups that belong to that Account. Similarly, when an Account is removed from the system though regardless of Contacts syncing enabled or network availability, the Contacts Provider will automatically remove Contacts, RawContacts, Data, and Groups that belong to that Account. Only contacts that are associated with an Account are synced \u00b6 More specifically, RawContacts that are not associated with an Account (local, device-only) are not synced. \u2139\ufe0f For more info, read about Local (device-only) contacts . Syncing is account specific (and therefore specific to RawContacts as a Contact may have one or more constituent RawContacts from different Accounts), which is why you must turn on Contact syncing in the system settings. For example, data belonging to a RawContact that is associated with a Google account (e.g. Gmail) will be available anywhere the Google account is used; in any Android or iOS device, a web browser, etc... Data is synced by Google\u2019s sync adapters between devices and their remote servers. Syncing depends on the account sync settings, which can be configured in the system settings app and possibly through some remote configuration. Here is an example of a newly created RawContact associated with a com.google Account prior to syncing, #### Contacts table Contact id: 31, lookupKey: 2059r31-38462A40563E3A4436 #### RawContacts table RawContact id: 31, contactId: 31, sourceId:null After sync, #### Contacts table Contact id: 31, lookupKey: 2059i7b975d4a8fec684e #### RawContacts table RawContact id: 31, contactId: 31, sourceId:7b975d4a8fec684e For a RawContact that is not associated with an Account (null), #### Contacts table Contact id: 32, lookupKey: 0r32-3032543A2E324644405A #### RawContacts table RawContact id: 32, contactId: 32, sourceId:null When are changes synced? \u00b6 In general, the Contacts Provider and the registered sync adapters are responsible for triggering sync events as long as Contacts sync is enabled for the Account in the system settings. You can manually trigger a sync through the system sync settings. Some events that will probably trigger a sync are; Getting network connection from a state where there was no network connection (offline -> online). Adding an Account. Removing an Account. Until changes are synced, local changes will not take effect. Some examples are; RawContact rows are marked for deletion but remain until synced. Group rows are marked for deletion but remain until synced. Newly created RawContacts may have a null or temporary source ID. New lookup key is not assigned after associating a local RawContact to an Account. Some custom data provided in this library are not synced \u00b6 The Gender , HandleName , Pokemon , RpgStats , and RpgProfession custom data will not be synced because they are not account specific and they have no sync adapters and no remote service to interface with. \u2139\ufe0f For more info, read Integrate custom data . Custom data from other apps may be synced \u00b6 This library does not sync contact data that belongs to other apps and services. For example, Google Contacts , WhatsApp, and other apps define their own set of custom data that their own sync adapters sync with their own remote services, which requires authentication. \u2139\ufe0f For more info, read Integrate custom data from other apps . This library does not provide sync adapters \u00b6 This library does not have any APIs related to syncing. It is considered out of scope of this library as it requires access to remote databases and account-specific data. Let's talk about it though since it is good to know how it works if you just want more insight. https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/contacts-provider#SyncAdapters The Contacts Provider is specifically designed for handling synchronization of contacts data between a device and an online service. This allows users to download existing data to a new device and upload existing data to a new account. Synchronization also ensures that users have the latest data at hand, regardless of the source of additions and changes. Another advantage of synchronization is that it makes contacts data available even when the device is not connected to the network. Although you can implement synchronization in a variety of ways, the Android system provides a plug-in synchronization framework that automates the following tasks: Checking network availability. Scheduling and executing synchronization, based on user preferences. Restarting synchronizations that have stopped. To use this framework, you supply a sync adapter plug-in. Each sync adapter is unique to a service and content provider, but can handle multiple account names for the same service. The framework also allows multiple sync adapters for the same service and provider. This library does not provide any sync adapters. Instead, it relies on existing sync adapters to do the syncing. Sync adapters and syncing are really out of scope of this library. Syncing is its own thing that typically happens outside of an application UI. This library is focused on Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on native and custom data to and from the local database.

This results in; x@x.com y@y.com z@z.com Changes are immediate and are not applied to the receiver \u00b6 These apply to set and clear functions. Changes are immediate. These functions will make the changes to the Contacts Provider database immediately. You do not need to use update APIs to commit the changes. Changes are not applied to the receiver. This function call does NOT mutate immutable or mutable receivers. Therefore, you should use query APIs or refresh extensions or process the result of this function call to get the most up-to-date reference to mutable or immutable entity that contains the changes in the Contacts Provider database. Performing default data management asynchronously \u00b6 Setting or clearing default data is done in the same thread as the call-site. This may result in a choppy UI. To perform the work in a different thread, use the Kotlin coroutine extensions provided in the async module. For more info, read Execute work outside of the UI thread using coroutines . You may, of course, use other multi-threading libraries or just do it yourself =) \u2139\ufe0f Extensions for Kotlin Flow and RxJava are also in the project roadmap. Performing default data management with permission \u00b6 Getting and setting/clearing default data require the android.permission.READ_CONTACTS and android.permission.WRITE_CONTACTS permissions respectively. If not granted, getting and setting/clearing default data will fail. Developer notes (or for advanced users) \u00b6 As per documentation, for a set of data rows with the same mimetype (e.g. a set of emails), there should only be one primary data row (e.g. email) per RawContact and one super primary data row per Contact. Furthermore, a data row that is super primary must also be primary. Unfortunately, the Contacts Provider does not do any data set validation for the Data columns IS_PRIMARY and IS_SUPER_PRIMARY . This means that it is possible to set more than one data row of the same mimetype as primary for the same RawContact and super primary for the same aggregate Contact. It is also possible to set a data row as super primary but not primary. Upholding the the contract is left to the us (the library). For example, given this relationship; Contact RawContact X Email A Email B RawContact Y Email C Email D When Emails A, B, C, and D are inserted with the RawContacts or after the RawContacts have been created, we get the following state; Email Primary Super Primary A 0 0 B 0 0 C 0 0 D 0 0 The state does not change when RawContact X is linked with RawContact Y. After setting Email A as the \"default\" email, it becomes primary and super primary; Email Primary Super Primary A 1 1 B 0 0 C 0 0 D 0 0 Then setting Email B as the default email, it becomes primary and super primary. Email A is no longer primary or super primary. Email Primary Super Primary A 0 0 B 1 1 C 0 0 D 0 0 Then setting Email C as the default email, it becomes primary and super primary. Email B is still primary because it belongs to a different RawContact than Email C. However, Email B is no longer the super primary as there can only be one per aggregate Contact. Email Primary Super Primary A 0 0 B 1 0 C 1 1 D 0 0 Then setting Email D as the default email, it becomes primary and super primary. Email C is no longer primary or super primary. Email Primary Super Primary A 0 0 B 1 0 C 0 0 D 1 1 Then clearing the default email D, removes its primary and super primary status. However, email B remains a primary but not a super primary. Email Primary Super Primary A 0 0 B 1 0 C 0 0 D 0 0 The above behavior is observed from the AOSP Contacts app. The \"super primary\" data of an aggregate Contact is referred to as the \"default\".","title":"Get set clear default Contact data"},{"location":"other/get-set-clear-default-data/#get-set-clear-default-contact-data","text":"Default contact data are instances of common data kinds that are marked as the default.

This means that it is possible to set more than one data row of the same mimetype as primary for the same RawContact and super primary for the same aggregate Contact. It is also possible to set a data row as super primary but not primary. Upholding the the contract is left to the us (the library). For example, given this relationship; Contact RawContact X Email A Email B RawContact Y Email C Email D When Emails A, B, C, and D are inserted with the RawContacts or after the RawContacts have been created, we get the following state; Email Primary Super Primary A 0 0 B 0 0 C 0 0 D 0 0 The state does not change when RawContact X is linked with RawContact Y.

Email A is no longer primary or super primary. Email Primary Super Primary A 0 0 B 1 1 C 0 0 D 0 0 Then setting Email C as the default email, it becomes primary and super primary.

For example, given the following tables, ### Contacts table Contact id: 32, displayName: X, starred: 0, timesContacted: 1, lastTimeContacted: 1573071785456, customRingtone: content://media/internal/audio/media/109, sendToVoicemail: 0 Contact id: 33, displayName: Y, starred: 1, timesContacted: 2, lastTimeContacted: 1573071750624, customRingtone: content://media/internal/audio/media/115, sendToVoicemail: 1 ### RawContacts table RawContact id: 30, contactId: 32, displayName: X, accountName: x@x.com, accountType: com.google, starred: 0, timesContacted: 1, lastTimeContacted: 1573071785456, customRingtone: content://media/internal/audio/media/109, sendToVoicemail: 0 RawContact id: 31, contactId: 33, displayName: Y, accountName: y@y.com, accountType: com.google, starred: 1, timesContacted: 2, lastTimeContacted: 1573071750624, customRingtone: content://media/internal/audio/media/115, sendToVoicemail: 1 ### Data table Data id: 57, rawContactId: 30, contactId: 32, mimeType: vnd.android.cursor.item/group_membership, data1: 18 Data id: 58, rawContactId: 30, contactId: 32, mimeType: vnd.android.cursor.item/name, data1: X, isPrimary: 1, isSuperPrimary: 1 Data id: 59, rawContactId: 30, contactId: 32, mimeType: vnd.android.cursor.item/email_v2, data1: x@x.com Data id: 60, rawContactId: 30, contactId: 32, mimeType: vnd.android.cursor.item/email_v2, data1: xx@x.com, isPrimary: 1, isSuperPrimary: 1 Data id: 63, rawContactId: 31, contactId: 33, mimeType: vnd.android.cursor.item/group_membership, data1: 6 Data id: 64, rawContactId: 31, contactId: 33, mimeType: vnd.android.cursor.item/name, data1: Y, isPrimary: 1, isSuperPrimary: 1 Data id: 65, rawContactId: 31, contactId: 33, mimeType: vnd.android.cursor.item/email_v2, data1: y@y.com Data id: 66, rawContactId: 31, contactId: 33, mimeType: vnd.android.cursor.item/email_v2, data1: yy@y.com, isPrimary: 1, isSuperPrimary: 1 When Contact X links/merges/joins Contact Y , the tables becomes; ### Contacts table Contact id: 32, displayName: X, starred: 1, timesContacted: 2, lastTimeContacted: 1573071785456, customRingtone: content://media/internal/audio/media/109, sendToVoicemail: 0 ### RawContacts table RawContact id: 30, contactId: 32, displayName: X, accountName: x@x.com, accountType: com.google, starred: 0, timesContacted: 1, lastTimeContacted: 1573071785456, customRingtone: content://media/internal/audio/media/109, sendToVoicemail: 0 RawContact id: 31, contactId: 32, displayName: Y, accountName: y@y.com, accountType: com.google, starred: 1, timesContacted: 2, lastTimeContacted: 1573071750624, customRingtone: content://media/internal/audio/media/115, sendToVoicemail: 1 ### Data table Data id: 57, rawContactId: 30, contactId: 32, mimeType: vnd.android.cursor.item/group_membership, data1: 18 Data id: 58, rawContactId: 30, contactId: 32, mimeType: vnd.android.cursor.item/name, data1: X, isPrimary: 1, isSuperPrimary: 1 Data id: 59, rawContactId: 30, contactId: 32, mimeType: vnd.android.cursor.item/email_v2, data1: x@x.com Data id: 60, rawContactId: 30, contactId: 32, mimeType: vnd.android.cursor.item/email_v2, data1: xx@x.com, isPrimary: 1, isSuperPrimary: 0 Data id: 63, rawContactId: 31, contactId: 32, mimeType: vnd.android.cursor.item/group_membership, data1: 6 Data id: 64, rawContactId: 31, contactId: 32, mimeType: vnd.android.cursor.item/name, data1: Y, isPrimary: 1, isSuperPrimary: 0 Data id: 65, rawContactId: 31, contactId: 32, mimeType: vnd.android.cursor.item/email_v2, data1: y@y.com Data id: 66, rawContactId: 31, contactId: 33, mimeType: vnd.android.cursor.item/email_v2, data1: yy@y.com, isPrimary: 1, isSuperPrimary: 0 What changed? Contact Y's row has been deleted and its column values have been merged into Contact X row. If the reverse occurred (Contact Y merged with Contact X), Contact Y's row would still be deleted. The difference is that Contact X's display name will be set to Contact Y's display name, which is done by the AOSP Contacts app manually by setting Contact Y's Data name row to be the \"default\" (isPrimary and isSuperPrimary both set to 1). \u2139\ufe0f The AggregationExceptions table records the linked RawContacts IDs in ascending order regardless of the order used in RAW_CONTACT_ID1 and RAW_CONTACT_ID2 at the time of merging. The RawContacts and Data table remains the same except the joined contactId column values have now been changed to the id of Contact X. All Data rows' isSuperPrimary value has been set to 0 though the isPrimary columns remain the same. In other words, this clears any \"default\" set before the link. These are done automatically by the Contacts Provider during the link operation. What is not done automatically by the Contacts Provider is that the name row of former Contact X is set as the default. The AOSP Contacts app does this manually. The Contacts Providers automatically sets the Contact display name to whatever the default name row is for the Contact, if available. For more info on Contact display name resolution, read the Contact Display Name and Default Name Rows section. \u2139\ufe0f Display name resolution is different for APIs below 21 (pre-lollipop). The display name of the RawContacts remain the same. The Groups table remains unmodified. Options updates Changes to the options (starred, timesContacted, lastTimeContacted, customRingtone, and sendToVoicemail) of a RawContact may affect the options of the parent Contact. On the other hand, changes to the options of the parent Contact will be propagated to all child RawContact options. Photo updates A RawContact may have a full-sized photo saved as a file and a thumbnail version of that saved in the Data table in a photo mimetype row. A Contact's full-sized photo and thumbnail are simply references to the \"chosen\" RawContact's full-sized photo and thumbnail (though the URIs may differ). \u2139\ufe0f When removing the photo in the AOSP contacts app, the photo data row is not immediately deleted, though the PHOTO_FILE_ID is immediately set to null. This may result in the PHOTO_URI and PHOTO_THUMBNAIL_URI to still have a valid image uri even though the photo has been \"removed\". This library immediately deletes the photo data row, which seems to work perfectly. Data inserts In the AOSP Contacts app, Data inserted in combined (raw) contacts mode will be associated to the first RawContact in the list sorted by the RawContact ID. \u2139\ufe0f This may not be the same as the RawContact referenced by ContactsColumns.NAME_RAW_CONTACT_ID . UI changes? The AOSP Contacts App does not display the groups field when displaying / editing Contacts that have multiple RawContacts (linked/merged/joined) in combined mode. However, it does allow editing individual RawContact Data rows in which case the groups field is displayed and editable. In the AOSP Contacts app, the name attribute used comes from the name row with IS_SUPER_PRIMARY set to true. This and all other \"unique\" mimetypes (organization) and non-unique mimetypes (email) per RawContact are shown only if they are not blank. Showing multiple RawContact's data in the same edit screen (combined mode) In older version of the AOSP, Android Open Source Project (AOSP) Contacts app, data from multiple RawContacts was being shown in the same edit screen. This caused a lot of confusion about which data belonged to which RawContact. Newer versions of AOSP Contacts only allow editing one RawContact at a time to avoid confusion. Though, several RawContacts' data are still shown (not-editable) in the same screen. AggregationExceptions table \u00b6 Given the following Contacts and their RawContacts; Contact A RawContact 1 Contact B RawContact 2 Contact C RawContact 3 Contact D RawContact 4 Linking one by one in this order; Contact B link Contact A Contact C link Contact D Contact C link Contact B Results in the following AggregationExceptions rows respectively; Aggregation exception id: 430, type: 1, rawContactId1: 1, rawContactId2: 2 Aggregation exception id: 430, type: 1, rawContactId1: 1, rawContactId2: 2 Aggregation exception id: 432, type: 1, rawContactId1: 3, rawContactId2: 4 Aggregation exception id: 436, type: 1, rawContactId1: 1, rawContactId2: 2 Aggregation exception id: 439, type: 1, rawContactId1: 1, rawContactId2: 3 Aggregation exception id: 442, type: 1, rawContactId1: 1, rawContactId2: 4 Aggregation exception id: 440, type: 1, rawContactId1: 2, rawContactId2: 3 Aggregation exception id: 443, type: 1, rawContactId1: 2, rawContactId2: 4 Aggregation exception id: 444, type: 1, rawContactId1: 3, rawContactId2: 4 There is a pattern here. RawContact ids are sorted in ascending order and linked from least to greatest exhaustively but no double links (1-2 is the same as 2-1). RawContact 1 has a row with RawContact 2, 3, and 4. RawContact 2 has a row with RawContact 3 and 4. RawContact 3 has a row with RawContact 4. Linking all in one go; Contact C link Contact A, B, D Results in the same AggregationExceptions rows. Unlinking results in the same AggregationExceptions rows except the type is 2 ( TYPE_KEEP_SEPARATE ). Contact Display Name and Default Name Rows \u00b6 If available, the \"default\" (isPrimary and isSuperPrimary set to 1) name row for a Contact is automatically set as the Contact display name by the Contacts Provider. Otherwise, the Contacts Provider chooses from any of the other suitable data from the aggregate Contact. \u2139\ufe0f The ContactsColumns.NAME_RAW_CONTACT_ID is automatically updated by the Contacts Provider along with the display name. The default status of other sources (e.g. email) does not affect the Contact display name. The AOSP Contacts app also sets the most recently updated name as the default at every update. This results in the Contact display name changing to the most recently updated name from one of the associated RawContacts. The \"most recently updated name\" is the name field that was last updated by the user when editing in the Contacts app, which is irrelevant to its value. It does not matter if the user deleted the last character of the name, added the same character back, and then saved. It still counts as the most recently updated. All of the above only applies to API 21 and above. Display name resolution is different for APIs below 21 (pre-Lollipop)! The ContactsColumns.NAME_RAW_CONTACT_ID was added in API 21. It changed the way display names are resolved for Contacts with more than one constituent RawContacts, which is what has been described so far. Before this change (APIs 20 and below), the AOSP Contacts app is still able to set the Contact display name somehow. I'm not sure how. If someone figures it out, please let me know. I tried updating the Contact DISPLAY_NAME directly but it does not work. Setting a name row as default also does not affect the Contact DISPLAY_NAME . Effects of linking/unlinking contacts \u00b6 When two or more Contacts (along with their constituent RawContacts) are linked into a single Contact those Contacts will be merged into one of the existing Contact row. The Contacts that have been merged into the single Contact will have their entries/rows in the Contacts table deleted. Unlinking will result in the original Contacts prior to linking to have new rows in the Contacts table with different IDs because the previously deleted row IDs cannot be reused. Getting Contacts that have been linked into a single Contact or Contacts whose row IDs have change after unlinking is still possible using the Contact lookup key. For more info, read about Contact lookup key vs ID .","title":"Link unlink Contacts"},{"location":"other/link-unlink-contacts/#link-unlink-contacts","text":"The Contacts Provider automatically aggregates similar RawContacts into a single Contact when it determines that they reference the same person. However, the Contacts Provider's aggregation algorithms are only as accurate as the Data belonging to these RawContacts. Sometimes, they are not enough to determine if they indeed are the same person. With this in mind, the Contacts Provider allows us to explicitly and forcefully specify whether two or more RawContacts reference the same person (Contact) or not. \u26a0\ufe0f The APIs for this have changed significantly since version 0.3.0 .

SimContactsQuery SimContactsInsert SimContactsUpdate SimContactsDelete SIM card state \u00b6 In order for any SIM card read or write operations to succeed, the default/active SIM card must be in a ready state. If no SIM card is in a ready state, then read/write operations will fail immediately. To check if the default/active SIM card is in a ready state, val isSimCardReady = Contacts ( context ). sim (). cardInfo . isReady SIM Contact data \u00b6 SIM Contact data consists of the name and number . \u2139\ufe0f Support for email was recently added in Android 12. I don't think it is stable yet. Regardless, it is too new so this library will wait a bit before adding support for it. Character limits \u00b6 The name and number are subject to the SIM card's maximum character limit, which is typically around 20-30 characters. This may vary per SIM card. Inserts or updates will fail if the limit is breached. The SimContactsInsert and SimContactsUpdate APIs provided in this library automatically detect max character limits and returns appropriate errors when limits are breached. However, you may also access these limits yourself if you want; val nameMaxLength = Contacts ( context ). sim (). cardInfo . maxCharacterLimits (). nameMaxLength () val numberMaxLength = Contacts ( context ). sim (). cardInfo . maxCharacterLimits (). numberMaxLength () Character limits are cached internally in shared preferences so that calculations need not occur everytime these functions are invoked.

The inserted contact may be assigned the ID of the deleted contact. DO NOT RELY ON THIS TO MATCH VALUES IN THE DATABASE! The SIM table does not support selection by ID so you can't use this for anything anyways. Duplicate entries are allowed \u00b6 Duplicate entries, multiple entries having the same name and/or number, are allowed. This follows the behavior of other smart phone and non-smart phone applications. Blanks are not allowed \u00b6 Blank contacts (name AND number are both null or blank) will NOT be inserted. The name OR number can be null or blank but not both. Some OEMs automatically sync SIM card data with Contacts Provider data \u00b6 Samsung and Xiaomi phones import contacts from SIM into the Contacts Provider. When using the builtin Samsung Contacts app (in Samsung phones), modifications made to the SIM contacts from the Contacts Provider are propagated to the SIM card and vice versa. AFAIK, Xiaomi phones do not have this feature. Samsung is most likely syncing the SIM contacts with the copy in the Contacts Provider via SyncAdapters. The RawContacts created in the Contacts Provider have a non-remote account name and type (pointing to the SIM card), accountName: primary.sim.account_name, accountType: vnd.sec.contact.sim Similarly, in Xiaomi phones (though not synced to/from SIM card and Contacts Provider), accountName: USIM, accountType: com.android.contacts.usim SIM contacts imported into the Contacts Provider have the same restrictions as the SIM card in that only columns available in the SIM are editable (_id, name, number, emails). Editing SIM contacts that appear in the Contacts Provider using 3rd party apps will fail, though it may be possible to do with builtin Contacts app such as the case with Samsung's Contacts app (depends on OEM). If you find any issues when using the SimContacts APIs, please raise an issue if you find any bugs or start a discussion and share your thoughts or knowledge =) Multi SIM card support \u00b6 Android 5.1 adds support for using more than one cellular carrier SIM card at a time . This feature lets users activate and use additional SIMs on devices that have two or more SIM card slots. The APIs in this library have not been tested against dual SIM card configurations. It should still work, at the very least the current default/active SIM card should be accessible. Please raise an issue if you find any bugs or start a discussion and share your thoughts or knowledge =) Limitations \u00b6 Projections, selections, and order is not supported by the IccProvider . Therefore, we are unable to provide include , where , orderBy , limit , and offset functions in our SimContactsQuery API. Due to all of these limitations, all queries will return all contacts in the SIM card. Consumers of this library can perform their own sorting and pagination if they wish. Depending on memory size, SIM cards can hold 200 to 500+ contacts . The most common being around 250. Most, if not all, SIM cards have less than 1mb memory (averaging 32KB to 64KB). Therefore, memory and speed should not be affected much by not being able to sort/order and paginate at the query level. Debugging \u00b6 To look at all of the rows in the SIM Contacts table, use the Context.logSimContactsTable function in the debug module. For more info, read Debug the Sim Contacts table . Known issues \u00b6 Samsung phones (and perhaps other OEMs) support emails (in addition to name and number) data ahead of the Android 12 release. Updating and deleting SIM contacts that have email data using the APIs provided in this library may fail. This issue does not occur when moving the SIM card to a different phone that does not support emails. Developer notes (or for advanced users) \u00b6 In building the SimContacts APIs provided in this library, I used the following hardware to observe the behavior of reading/writing to the SIM card. Smart phones Non-smart phones SIM cards Nexus 6P (Android 8) BLU Z5 (unknown OS) Mint Mobile Samsung Galaxy A71 (Android 11) For software, I used the following apps. Apps Smart phones SIM Card Info v1.1.6 Nexus 6P Samsung Contacts v12.7.10.12 Samsung Galaxy A71 \u2139\ufe0f The AOSP Contacts app and Google Contacts app can only import contacts from SIM card so they are not very helpful for us with this investigation. For Android code references, I used the internal IccProvider.java as reference to what the Android OS might be doing when 3rd party applications perform CRUD operations on SIM contacts. IccProvider @ Android 8 IccProvider @ Android 11 IccProvider @ Android 12 I'm using the content://icc/adn URI to read/write from/to SIM card. \u2139\ufe0f All of the investigation that I have done here may not apply for all SIM cards and phone OEMs! There is just way too many different SIM cards and phones out there for a single person (me) to test. However, I think that my findings should apply to most cases. Figuring out how to perform CRUD operations \u00b6 First, I added 20 contacts (name and number) to the SIM contacts using the BLU Z5 . The first contact is named \"a\" with number \"1\", the second is named \"ab\" with number \"12\", and so on. The last contact is named \"abcdefghijklmnopqrst\" with number \"12345678901234567890\". I did this because the BLU Z5 has determined that the maximum character limit for the name and number for my Mint Mobile SIM card is 20. \u2139\ufe0f The character limits are most likely set by the SIM card and/or calculated by the OS managing it based on how much total memory is available. I also added a contact named \"bro\" with no number and a nameless contact with with number \"5555555555\". For a total of 22 contacts in the SIM card. I loaded the SIM card to my Nexus 6P . Then, I logged all of the rows in content://icc/adn using the Context.logSimContactsTable debug function I wrote up in the debug module. SIM Contact id: 0, name: A, number: 1, emails: null SIM Contact id: 1, name: Ab, number: 12, emails: null SIM Contact id: 2, name: Abc, number: 123, emails: null SIM Contact id: 3, name: Abcd, number: 1234, emails: null SIM Contact id: 4, name: Abcde, number: 12345, emails: null SIM Contact id: 5, name: Abcdef, number: 123456, emails: null SIM Contact id: 6, name: Abcdefg, number: 1234567, emails: null SIM Contact id: 7, name: Abcdefgh, number: 12345678, emails: null SIM Contact id: 8, name: Abcdefghi, number: 123456789, emails: null SIM Contact id: 9, name: Abcdefghij, number: 1234567890, emails: null SIM Contact id: 10, name: Abcdefghijk, number: 12345678901, emails: null SIM Contact id: 11, name: Abcdefghijkl, number: 123456789012, emails: null SIM Contact id: 12, name: Abcdefghijklm, number: 1234567890123, emails: null SIM Contact id: 13, name: Abcdefghijklmn, number: 12345678901234, emails: null SIM Contact id: 14, name: Abcdefghijklmno, number: 123456789012345, emails: null SIM Contact id: 15, name: Abcdefghijklmnop, number: 1234567890123456, emails: null SIM Contact id: 16, name: Abcdefghijklmnopq, number: 12345678901234567, emails: null SIM Contact id: 17, name: Abcdefghijklmnopqr, number: 123456789012345678, emails: null SIM Contact id: 18, name: Abcdefghijklmnopqrs, number: 1234567890123456789, emails: null SIM Contact id: 19, name: Abcdefghijklmnopqrst, number: 12345678901234567890, emails: null SIM Contact id: 20, name: Bro, number: , emails: null SIM Contact id: 21, name: , number: 5555555555, emails: null Our SimContactsQuery also retrieves the same exact results! I am able to see all of the contacts in the SIM Info app except for the nameless contact with number \"5555555555\". I attempted to add a nameless contact using the SIM Info app but it does not allow reading/writing nameless contacts. \u2139\ufe0f This is probably a bug in the SIM Info app or a limitation that is intentionally imposed for some reason. I wish I could see the source code of the app! Deleting the first contact with ID of 0 using the SIM Info app works just fine. Deleting the contact with ID of 2 using our SimContactsDelete works just fine too. At this point the first 5 rows in the table are; SIM Contact id: 1, name: Ab, number: 12, emails: null SIM Contact id: 3, name: Abcd, number: 1234, emails: null SIM Contact id: 4, name: Abcde, number: 12345, emails: null SIM Contact id: 5, name: Abcdef, number: 123456, emails: null SIM Contact id: 6, name: Abcdefg, number: 1234567, emails: null Inserting a contact using the SIM Info app and our SimContactsInsert (in that order) works just fine, resulting in two new rows being added. One very interesting to note is that the IDs of the previously deleted rows (0 and 2) have been assigned to the newly inserted contacts! SIM Contact id: 0, name: SIM Info Contact, number: 8, emails: null SIM Contact id: 1, name: Ab, number: 12, emails: null SIM Contact id: 2, name: SimContactsInsert, number: 9, emails: null SIM Contact id: 3, name: Abcd, number: 1234, emails: null SIM Contact id: 4, name: Abcde, number: 12345, emails: null SIM Contact id: 5, name: Abcdef, number: 123456, emails: null SIM Contact id: 6, name: Abcdefg, number: 1234567, emails: null This means that the IDs should not be used as a reference to a particular contact because it could \"change\" in the process of deleting and inserting. As for updates, let's start with this table... SIM Contact id: 3, name: Abcd, number: 1234, emails: null SIM Contact id: 4, name: Abcde, number: 12345, emails: null Notice that Contact ID 0, 1, and 2 are available. Using the SIM Info app to \"update\" the contact with ID 4, we get... SIM Contact id: 3, name: Abcd, number: 1234, emails: null SIM Contact id: 4, name: xxx, number: 12345, emails: null The ID remains 4. We get the same result using our SimContactsUpdate API =) Thus, we have implemented CRUD APIs!!! Figuring out character limits \u00b6 The BLU Z5 non-smartphone has determined that the maximum character limit for the name and number for my Mint Mobile SIM card is 20. I inserted a contact with a name with 26 characters and another contact with a number with 21 characters using the SIM Info app. The first insert (26 char name) succeeded but the second failed (21 char number). SIM Contact id: 0, name: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz, number: 1, emails: null I did the same using our SimContactsInsert ... The same thing occurred. This means that the character limit is imposed on the number but perhaps not the name OR maybe the name has not reached the maximum. I tried inserting a name with over 100 characters and it failed. So there is a character limit for the name. I tried inserting names of shorter and shorter lengths until I find the max. It seems to be 30 characters. The character limits for the name is different for my Mint Mobile SIM card is different in the BLU Z5 vs Nexus 6P . BLU Z5 Nexus 6P name 20 30 number 20 20 I took out the SIM card from the Nexus 6P and plugging it back into the BLU Z5 to see if it will show the contacts that go over the 20 character limit. Both contacts with names longer than 20 characters are shown in the BLU Z5 BUT the name is truncated to 20. This could mean one of two things; The phones determine the character limits based on SIM card memory. The SIM card specifies the character limits but the BLU Z5 hard codes it to 20 regardless. Time to check with the Samsung Galaxy A71 ! The Samsung yielded the same results as the Nexus. So, perhaps it is just the self-imposed limitation of the BLU phone. One interesting difference between the Samsung and the Nexus is that our SimContactsInsert was indicating that the insert succeeded in the Samsung even though no new row was created in the SIM table (oh Samsung lol). The result Uri returned by the insert operation is null in the Nexus but not null in the Samsung. What this all means? Our SimContactsInsert and SimContactsUpdate APIs need to be able to detect the maximum character limits for the name and number before performing the actual insert or update operation. To figure out the max character limits, we can attempt to insert a string of length 30 (most names should fit there and most SIM cards have lower limits). Keep attempting to insert until insert succeeds (query if the row is actually created instead of just relying on the insert result), making the string shorter each time. Delete the successful insert and record the length of the string. Do this for both name and number and store the results in shared preferences mapped to a unique ID of the SIM card. We do not want to do this calculation everytime our APIs are used! Max character limits should be exposed our users via a public API. Furthermore, we cannot rely on the result of the insert operation alone. If the result Uri is not null, we must perform a query to sanity check that the actual name and number was inserted! Emails \u00b6 There is an \"emails\" column in the SIM table. CRUD operations for it was not officially supported until recently in Android 12. IccProvider @ Android 11 IccProvider @ Android 12 Look for \"TODO\" comments in the `IccProvider``. You will see TODOs for emails in Android 11 but not Android 12. On my Samsung Galaxy A71 running Android 11... The column name is actually \"emails\" with an \"s\" (plural). What I observed, no email = \",\" at least one email = \"email,\" There seems to be a trailing \",\" regardless. It seems like the emails are in CSV format (comma separated values). I was not able to delete rows with emails in them. I even tried updating the where clause used in our SimContactsDelete to include the email but it does not work. The builtin Samsung Contacts app is able to insert, update, and delete rows with emails. This probably means that we don't have access to the internal APIs that the Samsung Contacts app has. Keep in mind that my Samsung is running Android 11 and support for email was not added until Android 12. \u2139\ufe0f Classic Samsung to add features farther ahead of time than vanilla Android =) On my Nexus 6P running Android 8... The contacts with emails are shown without email data (emails are null in the SIM table). These rows are able to be updated and deleted. On my BLU Z5... SIM contacts with emails are shown without the email data. These rows are able to be updated and deleted. Duplicate entries \u00b6 Duplicate entries, multiple entries having the same name and/or number, seem to be allowed by smart phone and non-smart phone applications. Other considerations \u00b6 It seems like there are new APIs around SIM Contacts that were introduced in API 31; https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/ContactsContract.SimContacts https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/SimPhonebookContract Those APIs are too new to be used by this library, which supports API levels down to 19. So, we'll stick with using the content://icc/adn uri to read/write to SIM card until it becomes deprecated, if ever.","title":"About SIM contacts"},{"location":"sim/about-sim-contacts/#sim-contacts","text":"This library gives you APIs that allow you to read and write Contacts stored in the SIM card.

Deleting the contact with ID of 2 using our SimContactsDelete works just fine too. At this point the first 5 rows in the table are; SIM Contact id: 1, name: Ab, number: 12, emails: null SIM Contact id: 3, name: Abcd, number: 1234, emails: null SIM Contact id: 4, name: Abcde, number: 12345, emails: null SIM Contact id: 5, name: Abcdef, number: 123456, emails: null SIM Contact id: 6, name: Abcdefg, number: 1234567, emails: null Inserting a contact using the SIM Info app and our SimContactsInsert (in that order) works just fine, resulting in two new rows being added. One very interesting to note is that the IDs of the previously deleted rows (0 and 2) have been assigned to the newly inserted contacts! SIM Contact id: 0, name: SIM Info Contact, number: 8, emails: null SIM Contact id: 1, name: Ab, number: 12, emails: null SIM Contact id: 2, name: SimContactsInsert, number: 9, emails: null SIM Contact id: 3, name: Abcd, number: 1234, emails: null SIM Contact id: 4, name: Abcde, number: 12345, emails: null SIM Contact id: 5, name: Abcdef, number: 123456, emails: null SIM Contact id: 6, name: Abcdefg, number: 1234567, emails: null This means that the IDs should not be used as a reference to a particular contact because it could \"change\" in the process of deleting and inserting. As for updates, let's start with this table... SIM Contact id: 3, name: Abcd, number: 1234, emails: null SIM Contact id: 4, name: Abcde, number: 12345, emails: null Notice that Contact ID 0, 1, and 2 are available. Using the SIM Info app to \"update\" the contact with ID 4, we get... SIM Contact id: 3, name: Abcd, number: 1234, emails: null SIM Contact id: 4, name: xxx, number: 12345, emails: null The ID remains 4. We get the same result using our SimContactsUpdate API =) Thus, we have implemented CRUD APIs!!!","title":"Figuring out how to perform CRUD operations"},{"location":"sim/about-sim-contacts/#figuring-out-character-limits","text":"The BLU Z5 non-smartphone has determined that the maximum character limit for the name and number for my Mint Mobile SIM card is 20. I inserted a contact with a name with 26 characters and another contact with a number with 21 characters using the SIM Info app. The first insert (26 char name) succeeded but the second failed (21 char number). SIM Contact id: 0, name: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz, number: 1, emails: null I did the same using our SimContactsInsert ... The same thing occurred. This means that the character limit is imposed on the number but perhaps not the name OR maybe the name has not reached the maximum. I tried inserting a name with over 100 characters and it failed. So there is a character limit for the name. I tried inserting names of shorter and shorter lengths until I find the max. It seems to be 30 characters. The character limits for the name is different for my Mint Mobile SIM card is different in the BLU Z5 vs Nexus 6P . BLU Z5 Nexus 6P name 20 30 number 20 20 I took out the SIM card from the Nexus 6P and plugging it back into the BLU Z5 to see if it will show the contacts that go over the 20 character limit. Both contacts with names longer than 20 characters are shown in the BLU Z5 BUT the name is truncated to 20. This could mean one of two things; The phones determine the character limits based on SIM card memory. The SIM card specifies the character limits but the BLU Z5 hard codes it to 20 regardless. Time to check with the Samsung Galaxy A71 ! The Samsung yielded the same results as the Nexus. So, perhaps it is just the self-imposed limitation of the BLU phone. One interesting difference between the Samsung and the Nexus is that our SimContactsInsert was indicating that the insert succeeded in the Samsung even though no new row was created in the SIM table (oh Samsung lol). The result Uri returned by the insert operation is null in the Nexus but not null in the Samsung. What this all means? Our SimContactsInsert and SimContactsUpdate APIs need to be able to detect the maximum character limits for the name and number before performing the actual insert or update operation. To figure out the max character limits, we can attempt to insert a string of length 30 (most names should fit there and most SIM cards have lower limits). Keep attempting to insert until insert succeeds (query if the row is actually created instead of just relying on the insert result), making the string shorter each time. Delete the successful insert and record the length of the string. Do this for both name and number and store the results in shared preferences mapped to a unique ID of the SIM card. We do not want to do this calculation everytime our APIs are used! Max character limits should be exposed our users via a public API. Furthermore, we cannot rely on the result of the insert operation alone. If the result Uri is not null, we must perform a query to sanity check that the actual name and number was inserted!","title":"Figuring out character limits"},{"location":"sim/about-sim-contacts/#emails","text":"There is an \"emails\" column in the SIM table.
