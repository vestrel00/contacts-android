/**
 * A (vertical) [LinearLayout] that displays a list of [DataEntityWithTypeAndLabel] and handles the
 * modifications to the given mutable list. Each of the entity in the list is displayed in a
 * [DataEntityWithTypeAndLabelView]. An entity is only modified if it is mutable.
 *
 * Setting the [dataList] will automatically update the views. Any modifications in the views will
 * also be made to the [dataList].
 *
 * This is not an actual ListView. It **does not implement any optimizations** like view recycling.
 *
 * ## Note
 *
 * This is a very rudimentary view that is not styled or made to look good. It may not follow any
 * good practices and may even implement bad practices. Consumers of the library may choose to use
 * this as is or simply as a reference on how to implement this part of native Contacts app.
 *
 * This does not support state retention (e.g. device rotation). The OSS community may contribute to
 * this by implementing it.
 *
 * The community may contribute by styling and adding more features and customizations with these
 * views if desired.
 *
 * ## Developer Notes
 *
 * I usually am a proponent of passive views and don't add any logic to views. However, I will make
 * an exception for this basic view that I don't really encourage consumers to use.
