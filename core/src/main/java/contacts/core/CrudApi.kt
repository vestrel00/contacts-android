//
// This should actually be an internal interface. It is public because public APIs implement this.
// Anyways, this enforces some level of uniformity for all CRUD APIs. However, we should try to
// keep the contract loose to allow for the most flexibility. Who knows? Consumers might find some
// use for this. There is no howto page for this until we can find an official use for it.

     * Make sure to [unregister] the [listener] to prevent leaks! You only need to do this if the
     * [listener] lifecycle is less than the lifecycle of the [Contacts] instance.
     *
     * For example, if your application is holding one instance of [Contacts] throughout the entire
     * lifecycle of your [android.app.Application] (a singleton) and the [listener] passed here is
     * (or contains a reference to) an `Activity`, `Fragment`, or `View`, then you must [unregister]
     * the  [listener] before your Activity, Fragment, or View is destroyed. Otherwise, the
     * reference to the Activity, Fragment, or View will remain in memory for as long as your
     * `Application` is alive because there is a reference to it via this registry!
     *
     * However, if the [listener] does not have a reference to a non-Application `Context` or it
     * is meant to have the same lifecycle as your [android.app.Application], then there is no need
     * to [unregister].
