/**
 * Retrieves **visible** [Account]s from the [AccountManager] whose [Account.type] has a matching
 * [android.content.SyncAdapterType.accountType] where the
 * [android.content.SyncAdapterType.authority] is equal to
 * [android.provider.ContactsContract.AUTHORITY].
 *
 * If you look at all of the Accounts returned by the [AccountManager.getAccounts] in your 3rd
 * party app, you might see the following [Account.type]s...
 *
 * - "com.google" if you are signed into a Google account
 * - "com.google.android.gm.legacyimap" if you are signed into an Personal (IMAP) account
 * - "com.samsung.android.mobileservice" if the device is from Samsung
 *
 * When you open the Google Contacts app (assuming that it is a 3rd party app that did not come
 * pre-installed in the OS) and select an Account to save a new Contact to, you will notice that it
 * only allows you to choose between the Google account of local/device account. It does not show
 * the Personal (IMAP) account or the Samsung Account. The reason is (probably) because there is
 * no sync adapter for Contacts for those accounts. This API filters such accounts for you because
 * this API is specific to accounts relating to Contacts!
 *
 * Another thing to note is that Samsung (type "com.osp.app.signin"), Xiaomi (type "com.xiaomi"),
 * and perhaps other OEMs do not allow 3rd party (non-system) apps (those that do not come
 * pre-installed in the OS) to access their accounts. Your app does not have visibility on this
 * accounts, unless this API is packaged as part of a custom Android OS, which would be super cool.
 * Such accounts are not returned by this query. In a Samsung device, the Samsung Contacts app
 * is able to show the Samsung account but the Google Contacts app cannot.
 *
 * ## Permissions
 *
 * The [AccountsPermissions.GET_ACCOUNTS_PERMISSION] is assumed to have been granted already in
 * these examples for brevity. If not granted, the query will do
 * nothing and return an empty list.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * Here is an example of how to get all accounts with type "com.google".
 *
 * In Kotlin,
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val accounts = accountsQuery.withType("com.google").find()
 * ```
 *
 * In Java,
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * List<Account> accounts = accountsQuery.withType("com.google").find();
 * ```
 *
 * ## Where, orderBy, offset, and limit
 *
 * Assuming that there are not that many Accounts per user / device (can you think of someone that
 * has over 100 different Accounts that they are logged in to?). This assumption means that the
 * query function of Accounts need not be as extensive (or at all) as other Queries. Where, orderBy,
 * offset, and limit functions are left to consumers to implement if they wish.
 *
 * ## Invalid or invisible Accounts
 *
 * Samsung Accounts (type "com.osp.app.signin") and Xiaomi Accounts (type "com.xiaomi") on Samsung
 * and Xiaomi devices respectively are not returned by the [AccountManager] if the calling app is a
 * 3rd party app (does not come pre-installed with the OS).
 *
 * In Samsung devices, the default Contacts app that comes pre-installed is Samsung Contacts. The
 * Samsung Contacts app allows users to create and filter contacts using the Samsung account.
 * However, 3rd party apps such as Google Contacts do not have visibility of the Samsung account.
 * Contacts belonging to Samsung accounts are still accessible to 3rd party apps, it's just that the
 * Accounts are not.
 *
 * In Xiaomi devices, the default Contacts app that comes pre-installed (in the global version) is
 * the Google Contacts app. The Google Contacts app allows users to create and filter contacts
 * using the Samsung account. However, 3rd party Contacts apps do not have visibility of the Xiaomi
 * account. Contacts belonging to Xiaomi accounts are still accessible to 3rd party apps, it's just
 * that the Accounts are not.
 *
 * There may be other OEMs aside from Samsung and Xiaomi that have similar caveats.
