/**
 * Queries the Contacts, RawContacts, and Data tables and returns the one and only profile
 * [Contact], if available.
 *
 * ## Permissions
 *
 * The [ContactsPermissions.READ_PERMISSION] is assumed to have been granted already in these
 * examples for brevity. If not granted, the query will do nothing and return null.
 *
 * For API 22 and below, the permission "android.permission.READ_PROFILE" is also required but only
 * at the manifest level. Prior to API 23 (Marshmallow), permissions needed to be granted prior
 * to installation instead of at runtime.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * Here is an example query that returns the profile [Contact]. Include only RawContacts belonging
 * to the given account. Include only the name and email properties of the profile [Contact].
 *
 * In Kotlin,
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val profileContact : Contact? = profileQuery.
 *      .accounts(account)
 *      .include { Name.all + Address.all }
 *      .find()
 * ```
 *
 * In Java,
 *
 * ```java
 * import static contacts.core.Fields.*;
 *
 * List<Contact> profileContact = profileQuery
 *      .accounts(account)
 *      .include(new ArrayList<>() {{
 *           addAll(Name.getAll());
 *           addAll(Address.getAll());
 *       }})
 *      .find();
 * ```

interface ProfileQuery : CrudApi {

    /**
     * Limits the RawContacts and associated data to those associated with one of the given
     * accounts. The Contact returned will not contain data that belongs to other accounts not
     * specified in [accounts].
     *
     * If no accounts are specified (this function is not called or called with no Accounts), then
     * all RawContacts and associated data are included in the search.
     *
     * A null [Account] may be provided here, which results in RawContacts with no associated
     * Account to be included in the search. RawContacts without an associated account are
     * considered local or device-only contacts, which are not synced.

     *
     * If no fields are specified (empty list), then all fields are included. Otherwise, only
     * the specified fields will be included.
     *
     * When all fields are included in a query operation, all properties of the profile Contacts
     * and Data are populated with values from the database. Properties of fields that are included
     * are not guaranteed to be non-null because the database may actually have no data for the
     * corresponding field.

     * When only some fields are included, only those included properties of the profile Contacts
     * and Data are populated with values from the database. Properties of fields that are not
     * included are guaranteed to be null.
     *
     * ## Performance
     *
     * It is recommended to only include fields that will be used to save CPU and memory.
     *
     * ## Including all fields
     *
     * If you want to include all fields, including custom data fields, then passing in an empty
     * list or not invoking this function is the most performant way to do it because internal
     * checks will be disabled (less lines of code executed).
     *
     * ## Developer notes
     *
     * Passing in an empty list here should set the reference to the internal field set to null to
     * indicate that include field checks should be disabled when processing cursor data via
     * implementations of [contacts.core.entities.cursor.AbstractEntityCursor].
     *
     * When the internal field set is set to null, all fields should be included in the projection
     * list of the actual query, which is why the [allFieldsIfNull] functions exist. In order to
     * disable include field checks in the cursors, [contacts.core.util.query] provides a parameter
     * to set the cursor holder's include fields to null.

     *
     * It is recommended to only include fields that will be used to save CPU and memory.
     *
     * #### Developer notes
     *
     * So, why not just add these fields to [DataRawContactsFields]?
     *
     * The reason is that [DataRawContactsFields], and everything in [Fields], are used for
     * **Data table** queries. Data table queries uses the
     * [android.provider.ContactsContract.DataColumnsWithJoins], which does not include
     * [android.provider.ContactsContract.SyncColumns] required to determine the
     * [contacts.core.entities.RawContact.account].
     *
     * Furthermore, the display name and options values in the returned rows reference the Contact's
     * values instead of the RawContact's values.
     *
     * Therefore, it made sense to make sure that [RawContactsFields] cannot be a part of a where
     * clause but can be included.
     *
     * ## Including all fields
     *
     * If you want to include all fields, including custom data fields, then passing in an empty
     * list or not invoking this function is the most performant way to do it because internal
     * checks will be disabled (less lines of code executed).
     *
     * #### Developer notes
     *
     * Passing in an empty list here should set the reference to the internal field set to null to
     * indicate that include field checks should be disabled when processing cursor data via
     * implementations of [contacts.core.entities.cursor.AbstractEntityCursor].
     *
     * When the internal field set is set to null, all fields should be included in the projection
     * list of the actual query, which is why the [allFieldsIfNull] functions exist. In order to
