/**
 * Queries the Contacts, RawContacts, and Data tables and returns the one and only profile
 * [Contact], if available.
 *
 * ## Permissions
 *
 * The [ContactsPermissions.READ_PERMISSION] is assumed to have been granted already in these
 * examples for brevity. If not granted, the query will do nothing and return null.
 *
 * For API 22 and below, the permission "android.permission.READ_PROFILE" is also required but only
 * at the manifest level. Prior to API 23 (Marshmallow), permissions needed to be granted prior
 * to installation instead of at runtime.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * Here is an example query that returns the profile [Contact]. Include only RawContacts belonging
 * to the given account. Include only the name and email properties of the profile [Contact].
 *
 * In Kotlin,
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val profileContact : Contact? = profileQuery.
 *      .accounts(account)
 *      .include { Name.all + Address.all }
 *      .find()
 * ```
 *
 * In Java,
 *
 * ```java
 * import static contacts.core.Fields.*;
 *
 * List<Contact> contacts = profileQuery
 *      .accounts(account)
 *      .include(new ArrayList<>() {{
 *           addAll(Name.getAll());
 *           addAll(Address.getAll());
 *       }})
 *      .find();
 * ```

interface ProfileQuery : CrudApi {

    /**
     * If [includeBlanks] is set to true, then queries may include blank RawContacts. Otherwise,
     * blanks will not be included. If the Profile Contact only contains blank RawContacts, then
     * the query will still return the blank Contact regardless of this flag. This flag is set to
     * true by default.
     *
     * This flag is set to true by default, which results in more database queries so setting this
     * to false will increase performance, especially for large Contacts databases.
     *
     * The Contacts Providers allows for RawContacts that have no rows in the Data table (let's call
     * them "blanks") to exist. The native Contacts app does not allow insertion of new RawContacts
     * without at least one data row. It also deletes blanks on update. Despite seemingly not
     * allowing blanks, the native Contacts app shows them.
     *
     * ## Performance
     *
     * This may require one or more additional queries, internally performed in this function, which
     * increases the time it takes for [find] to complete. Therefore, you should only specify this
     * if you actually need it.

    /**
     * Includes only the given set of [fields] (data) in each of the matching contacts.
     *
     * The matching contacts **may** have non-null data for each of the included fields. Fields
     * that are included will not guarantee non-null data in the returned contact instances because
     * some data may actually be null in the database.
     *
     * If no fields are specified, then all fields are included. Otherwise, only the specified
     * fields will be included in addition to required API fields [Fields.Required] (e.g. IDs),
     * which are always included.
     *
     * Note that this may affect performance. It is recommended to only include fields that will be
     * used to save CPU and memory.
     *
     * ## Performing updates on entities with partial includes
     *
     * When the query [include] function is used, only certain data will be included in the returned
     * entities. All other data are guaranteed to be null (except for those in [Fields.Required]).
     * When performing updates on entities that have only partial data included, make sure to use
     * the same included fields in the update operation as the included fields used in the query.
     * This will ensure that the set of data queried and updated are the same. For example, in order
     * to get and set only email addresses and leave everything the same in the database...
     *
     * ```kotlin
     * val contacts = query.include(Fields.Email.Address).find()
     * val mutableContacts = setEmailAddresses(contacts)
     * update.contacts(mutableContacts).include(Fields.Email.Address).commit()
     * ```
     *
     * On the other hand, you may intentionally include only some data and perform updates without
     * on all data (not just the included ones) to effectively delete all non-included data. This
     * is, currently, a feature- not a bug! For example, in order to get and set only email
     * addresses and set all other data to null (such as phone numbers, name, etc) in the database..
     *
     * ```kotlin
     * val contacts = query.include(Fields.Email.Address).find()
     * val mutableContacts = setEmailAddresses(contacts)
     * update.contacts(mutableContacts).include(Fields.all).commit()
     * ```
     *
     * This gives you the most flexibility when it comes to specifying what fields to
     * include/exclude in queries, inserts, and update, which will allow you to do things beyond
     * your wildest imagination!
