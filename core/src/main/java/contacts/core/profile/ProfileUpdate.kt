/**
 * Updates one or more (Profile) raw contacts' rows in the data table.
 *
 * ## Blank data are deleted
 *
 * Blank data will be deleted. For example, if all properties of an email are all null, empty, or
 * blank, then the email is deleted. This is the same behavior as the native Contacts app. This
 * behavior cannot be modified.
 *
 * Note that in cases where blank data are deleted, existing RawContact instances (in memory) will
 * still have references to the deleted data instance. The RawContact instances (in memory) must be
 * refreshed to get the most up-to-date data sets.
 *
 * ## Permissions
 *
 * The [ContactsPermissions.WRITE_PERMISSION] is assumed to have been granted already in these
 * examples for brevity. All updates will do nothing if these permissions are not granted.
 *
 * For API 22 and below, the permission "android.permission.WRITE_PROFILE" is also required but
 * only at the manifest level. Prior to API 23 (Marshmallow), permissions needed to be granted
 * prior to installation instead of at runtime.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * To update a (profile) raw contact's name to "john doe" and add an email "john@doe.com";
 *
 * In Kotlin,
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val mutableRawContact = rawContact.mutableCopy {
 *      name = NewName(
 *          givenName = "john"
 *          familyName = "doe"
 *      )
 *      emails.add(NewEmail(
 *          type = EmailEntity.Type.HOME
 *          address = "john@doe.com"
 *      ))
 * }
 *
 * val result = profileUpdate
 *      .rawContacts(mutableRawContact)
 *      .commit()
 * ```
 *
 * Java,
 *
 * ```java
 * NewName name = new NewName();
 * name.setGivenName("john");
 * name.setFamilyName("doe");
 *
 * NewEmail email = new NewEmail();
 * email.setType(EmailEntity.Type.HOME);
 * email.setAddress("john@doe.com");
 *
 * MutableRawContact mutableRawContact = rawContact.mutableCopy();
 * mutableRawContact.setName(name);
 * mutableRawContact.getEmails().add(email);
 *
 * Update.Result result = profileUpdate
 *      .rawContacts(mutableRawContact)
 *      .commit();
 * ```
 *
 * ## Developer notes
 *
 * This is so similar to Update that we could just use Update to handle profile entities too.
 * However, keeping it separate like this gives us the most flexibility and cohesiveness of
 * profile APIs.

interface ProfileUpdate {

    /**
     * If [deleteBlanks] is set to true, then updating blank profile RawContacts
     * ([ExistingRawContactEntity.isBlank]) or blank a profile Contact
     * ([ExistingContactEntity.isBlank]) will result in their deletion. Otherwise, blanks will not
     * be deleted and will result in a failed operation. This flag is set to true by default.
     *
     * The Contacts Providers allows for RawContacts that have no rows in the Data table (let's call
     * them "blanks") to exist. The native Contacts app does not allow insertion of new RawContacts
     * without at least one data row. It also deletes blanks on update. Despite seemingly not
     * allowing blanks, the native Contacts app shows them.
     *
     * Note that blank data are deleted. For example, if all properties of an email are all null,
     * empty, or blank, then the email is deleted. This is the same behavior as the native Contacts
     * app. This is the same behavior as the native Contacts app. This behavior cannot be modified.

    /**
     * Specifies that only the given set of [fields] (data) will be updated.
     *
     * If no fields are specified, then all fields will be updated. Otherwise, only the specified
     * fields will be updating in addition to required API fields [Fields.Required] (e.g. IDs),
     * which are always included.
     *
     * Note that this may affect performance. It is recommended to only include fields that will be
     * used to save CPU and memory.
     *
     * ## Performing updates on entities with partial includes
     *
     * When the query include function is used, only certain data will be included in the returned
     * entities. All other data are guaranteed to be null (except for those in [Fields.Required]).
     * When performing updates on entities that have only partial data included, make sure to use
     * the same included fields in the update operation as the included fields used in the query.
     * This will ensure that the set of data queried and updated are the same. For example, in order
     * to get and set only email addresses and leave everything the same in the database...
     *
     * ```kotlin
     * val profile = query.include(Fields.Email.Address).find()
     * val mutableProfile = setEmailAddresses(profile)
     * update.contact(mutableProfile).include(Fields.Email.Address).commit()
     * ```
     *
     * On the other hand, you may intentionally include only some data and perform updates without
     * on all data (not just the included ones) to effectively delete all non-included data. This
     * is, currently, a feature- not a bug! For example, in order to get and set only email
     * addresses and set all other data to null (such as phone numbers, name, etc) in the database..
     *
     * ```kotlin
     * val profile = query.include(Fields.Email.Address).find()
     * val mutableProfile = setEmailAddresses(profile)
     * update.contact(mutableProfile).include(Fields.all).commit()
     * ```
     *
     * This gives you the most flexibility when it comes to specifying what fields to
     * include/exclude in queries, inserts, and update, which will allow you to do things beyond
     * your wildest imagination!
