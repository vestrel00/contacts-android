/**
 * Inserts one (Profile) raw contact into the RawContacts table and all associated Data to the Data
 * table. The RawContact and Data table rows inserted here are stored in a special part of the
 * respective tables and are not visible via regular queries. Use [ProfileQuery] for retrieval.
 *
 * If the (Profile) Contact does not yet exist, one will be created. Otherwise, the raw contact will
 * be automatically associated with / belong to the (Profile) Contact upon creation. Note that there
 * is zero or one (Profile) Contact, which may have one or more RawContacts.
 *
 * As per documentation in [android.provider.ContactsContract.Profile],
 *
 * > The user's profile entry cannot be created explicitly (attempting to do so will throw an
 * > exception). When a raw contact is inserted into the profile, the provider will check for the
 * > existence of a profile on the device. If one is found, the raw contact's RawContacts.CONTACT_ID
 * > column gets the _ID of the profile Contact. If no match is found, the profile Contact is
 * > created and its _ID is put into the RawContacts.CONTACT_ID column of the newly inserted raw
 * > contact.
 *
 * ## Blank data are ignored
 *
 * Blank data will be ignored. For example, if all properties of an email are all null, empty, or
 * blank, then the email is not inserted. This is the same behavior as the native Contacts app. This
 * behavior cannot be modified.
 *
 * ## Permissions
 *
 * The [ContactsPermissions.WRITE_PERMISSION] and
 * [contacts.core.accounts.AccountsPermissions.GET_ACCOUNTS_PERMISSION] are assumed to have been
 * granted already in these examples for brevity. All inserts will do nothing if these permissions
 * are not granted.
 *
 * For API 22 and below, the permission "android.permission.WRITE_PROFILE" is also required but only
 * at the manifest level. Prior to API 23 (Marshmallow), permissions needed to be granted prior
 * to installation instead of at runtime.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * To insert a (Profile) raw contact with the name "john doe" with email "john@doe.com" for the
 * local account (no account), not allowing multiple raw contacts per account;
 *
 * In Kotlin,
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val result = profileInsert
 *      .rawContact {
 *          name = NewName(
 *              givenName = "john"
 *              familyName = "doe"
 *          )
 *          emails.add(NewEmail(
 *              type = EmailEntity.Type.HOME
 *              address = "john@doe.com"
 *          ))
 *      }
 *      .commit()
 * ```
 *
 * In Java,
 *
 * ```java
 * NewName name = new NewName();
 * name.setGivenName("john");
 * name.setFamilyName("doe");
 *
 * NewEmail email = new NewEmail();
 * email.setType(EmailEntity.Type.HOME);
 * email.setAddress("john@doe.com");
 *
 * List<NewEmail> emails = new ArrayList<>();
 * emails.add(email);
 *
 * NewRawContact rawContact = new NewRawContact();
 * rawContact.setName(name);
 * rawContact.setEmails(emails);
 *
 * ProfileInsert.Result result = profileInsert
 *      .rawContact(rawContact)
 *      .commit();
 * ```

     *
     * The Contacts Providers allows for RawContacts that have no rows in the Data table (let's call

     * allowing blanks, the native Contacts app shows them.

     * personal profile data from that source." In other words, one account can have one profile

     *
     * **For Lollipop (API 22) and below**
     *
     * When an Account is added, from a state where no accounts have yet been added to the system, the

     * RawContacts inserted without an associated account will automatically get assigned to an account
     * if there are any available. This may take a few seconds, whenever the Contacts Provider decides

     *
     * **For Marshmallow (API 23) and above**
     *
     * The Contacts Provider no longer associates local contacts to an account when an account is or
     * becomes available. Local contacts remain local.

     * **Account removal**
