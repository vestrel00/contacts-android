/**
 * Contains a set of [fields] to include.
 *
 * ## Dev notes
 *
 * Note that the Android contacts Data table uses generic column names (e.g. data1, data2, ...)
 * to distinguish between the different kinds of data it represents. For example, the column
 * name of [NameFields.DisplayName] is the same as [AddressFields.FormattedAddress], which is
 * 'data1'. This means that [AddressFields.FormattedAddress] is also included when
 * [NameFields.DisplayName] is included. There is no workaround for this because the
 * [ContentResolver.query] function only takes in an array of column names.
 *
 * What we can do in order to not include data that consumers are not interested in is to use
 * [fields] to filter out data fields in the query results that are not included. This does not save
 * CPU but does save RAM. This way, consumers don't have to retain references to hundreds or
 * thousands of entities that contain data they don't use and did not ask for.
