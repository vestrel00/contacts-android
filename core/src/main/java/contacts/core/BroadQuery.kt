/**
 * A generalized version of [Query], that lets the Contacts Provider perform the search using its
 * own custom matching algorithm. It allows you to get the exact same search results as the native
 * Contacts app!
 *
 * This type of query is the basis of an app that does a broad search of the Contacts Provider. The
 * technique is useful for apps that want to implement functionality similar to the People app's
 * contact list screen.
 *
 * Custom mimetypes / data are excluded from the search! Use [Query] to search for contacts using
 * custom data.
 *
 * If you need more granularity and customizations when providing matching criteria, use [Query].
 * For example, getting a Contact by ID is not supported by [BroadQuery] but can be achieved by
 * [Query].
 *
 * ## Permissions
 *
 * The [ContactsPermissions.READ_PERMISSION] is assumed to have been granted already in these
 * examples for brevity. If not granted, the query will do nothing and return an empty list.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * Here is an example query that returns the first 10 [Contact]s, skipping the first 5, where the
 * any Contact data (e.g. name, email, address, phone, etc) matches the search term "john", ordered
 * by the Contact display name primary (given name first) in ascending order (ignoring case).  Only
 * Contacts with at least one RawContact belonging to the given account and groups are included.
 * Only the full name and email address attributes of the [Contact] objects are included.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * import contacts.core.Fields.Name
 * import contacts.core.Fields.Address
 * import contacts.core.ContactsFields.DisplayNamePrimary
 *
 * val contacts : List<Contact> = broadQuery.
 *      .accounts(account)
 *      .groups(groups)
 *      .include(Name, Address)
 *      .whereAnyContactDataPartiallyMatches("john")
 *      .orderBy(DisplayNamePrimary.asc())
 *      .offset(5)
 *      .limit(10)
 *      .find()
 * ```
 *
 * ## How does the matching process work?
 *
 * This query lets the Contacts Provider perform the search using its own custom matching algorithm.
 *
 * Most, but not all, Contact data are included in the matching process. Some are not probably
 * because some data may result in unintentional matching.
 *
 * See [AbstractDataFieldSet.forMatching] documentation on all the fields that are included in
 * this match.
 *
 * **Custom data are not included in the matching process!** To match custom data, use [Query].
 *
 * Data matching is more sophisticated under the hood than [Query]. The Contacts Provider matches
 * parts of several types of data in segments. For example, a Contact having the email
 * "hologram@gram.net" will be matched with the following texts;
 *
 * - h
 * - HOLO
 * - @g
 * - @gram.net
 * - gram@
 * - net
 * - holo.net
 * - hologram.net
 *
 * But will NOT be matched with the following texts;
 *
 * - olo
 * - @
 * - gram@gram
 * - am@gram.net
 *
 * Similarly, a Contact having the name "Zack Air" will be matched with the following texts;
 *
 * - z
 * - zack
 * - zack, air
 * - air, zack
 * - za a
 * - , z
 * - , a
 * - ,a
 *
 * But will NOT be matched with the following texts;
 *
 * - ack
 * - ir
 * - ,
 *
 * Another example is a Contact having the note "Lots   of   spa        ces." will be matched with
 * the following texts;
 *
 * - l
 * - lots
 * - lots of
 * - of lots
 * - ces spa       lots of.
 * - lo o sp ce . . . . .
 *
 * But will NOT be matched with the following texts;
 *
 * - .
 * - ots
 *
 * Several types of data are matched in segments. E.G. A Contact with display name "Bell Zee" and
 * phone numbers "987", "1 23", and "456" will be matched with "be bell ze 9 123 1 98 456".
 *
 * Matching is **case-insensitive** (case is ignored).

interface BroadQuery {

    /**
     * If [includeBlanks] is set to true, then queries may include blank RawContacts. Otherwise,
     * blanks are not guaranteed to be included. This flag is set to true by default, which results
     * in more database queries so setting this to false will increase performance, especially for
     * large Contacts databases.
     *
     * The Contacts Providers allows for RawContacts that have no rows in the Data table (let's call
     * them "blanks") to exist. The native Contacts app does not allow insertion of new RawContacts
     * without at least one data row. It also deletes blanks on update. Despite seemingly not
     * allowing blanks, the native Contacts app shows them.
     *
     * There are two scenarios where blanks may not be returned if this flag is set to false.
     *
     * 1. Contact with RawContact(s) with no Data row(s).
     *     - In this case, the Contact is blank as well as its RawContact(s).
     * 2. Contact that has a RawContact with Data row(s) and a RawContact with no Data rows.
     *     - In this case, the Contact and the RawContact with Data row(s) are not blank but the
     *     RawContact with no Data row is blank.

     * If no fields are specified, then all fields are included. Otherwise, only the specified

     *
     * Note that this may affect performance. It is recommended to only include fields that will be
     * used to save CPU and memory.
     *
     * ## Performing updates on entities with partial includes
     *
     * When the query [include] function is used, only certain data will be included in the returned
     * entities. All other data are guaranteed to be null (except for those in [Fields.Required]).
     * When performing updates on entities that have only partial data included, make sure to use
     * the same included fields in the update operation as the included fields used in the query.
     * This will ensure that the set of data queried and updated are the same. For example, in order
     * to get and set only email addresses and leave everything the same in the database...
     *
     * ```kotlin
     * val contacts = query.include(Fields.Email.Address).find()
     * val mutableContacts = setEmailAddresses(contacts)
     * update.contacts(mutableContacts).include(Fields.Email.Address).commit()
     * ```
     *
     * On the other hand, you may intentionally include only some data and perform updates without
     * on all data (not just the included ones) to effectively delete all non-included data. This
     * is, currently, a feature- not a bug! For example, in order to get and set only email
     * addresses and set all other data to null (such as phone numbers, name, etc) in the database..
     *
     * ```kotlin
     * val contacts = query.include(Fields.Email.Address).find()
     * val mutableContacts = setEmailAddresses(contacts)
     * update.contacts(mutableContacts).include(Fields.all).commit()
     * ```
     *
     * This gives you the most flexibility when it comes to specifying what fields to
     * include/exclude in queries, inserts, and update, which will allow you to do things beyond
     * your wildest imagination!

     * (in addition to [ContactsFields]), use [contacts.core.util.ContactsComparator].
     *
     * ## Developer Notes
     *
     * This API DOES NOT support ordering by Data table columns ([Fields]). It used to support it
     * but it has been removed for optimization purposes. This now only supports ordering by
     * Contacts table fields ([ContactsFields]).
     *
     * **If this supported ordering by Data table fields**, then it would be unable to use the
     * ORDER BY, LIMIT, and OFFSET functions of a raw database query and custom ordering via
     * Comparators is required.
     *
     * The Data table uses generic column names (e.g. data1, data2, ...) using the column 'mimetype'
     * to distinguish the type of data in that generic column. For example, the column name of
     * [NameFields.DisplayName] is the same as [AddressFields.FormattedAddress], which is 'data1'.
     * This means that if you order by the display name, you are also ordering by the formatted
     * address and all other columns whose value is 'data1'. This API could work around this
     * limitation by performing the ordering, limiting, and offsetting manually after
     * **all matching** contacts have been retrieved before returning it to the consumer.
     *
     * Note that there is no workaround for the [include] function because the
     * [ContentResolver.query] function only takes in an array of column names. This means that
     * including [NameFields.DisplayName] ('data1') will also result in the inclusion of
     * [AddressFields.FormattedAddress] ('data1').
