/**
 * A generalized version of [Query], that lets the Contacts Provider perform the search using its
 * own custom matching algorithm. It allows you to get the exact same search results as the AOSP
 * Contacts app!
 *
 * This type of query is the basis of an app that does a broad search of the Contacts Provider. The
 * technique is useful for apps that want to implement functionality similar to the People app's
 * contact list screen.
 *
 * Custom mimetypes / data are excluded from the search! Use [Query] to search for contacts using
 * custom data.
 *
 * If you need more granularity and customizations when providing matching criteria, use [Query].
 * For example, getting a Contact by ID is not supported by [BroadQuery] but can be achieved by
 * [Query].
 *
 * ## How does the matching process work?
 *
 * See the [Match].
 *
 * ## Permissions
 *
 * The [ContactsPermissions.READ_PERMISSION] is assumed to have been granted already in these
 * examples for brevity. If not granted, the query will do nothing and return an empty list.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * Here is an example query that returns the first 10 [Contact]s, skipping the first 5, where the
 * any Contact data (e.g. name, email, address, phone, note, etc) partially matches the search term
 * "john", ordered by the Contact display name primary (given name first) in ascending order
 * (ignoring case). Include only Contacts with at least one RawContact belonging to the given
 * account and groups. Include only the name and email properties of [Contact]s.
 *
 * In Kotlin,
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val contacts = broadQuery
 *      .accounts(account)
 *      .groups(groups)
 *      .include { Name.all + Address.all }
 *      .wherePartiallyMatches("john")
 *      .orderBy(ContactsFields.DisplayNamePrimary.asc())
 *      .offset(5)
 *      .limit(10)
 *      .find()
 * ```
 *
 * In Java,
 *
 * ```java
 * import static contacts.core.Fields.*;
 * import static contacts.core.OrderByKt.*;
 *
 * List<Contact> contacts = broadQuery
 *      .accounts(account)
 *      .groups(groups)
 *      .include(new ArrayList<>() {{
 *           addAll(Name.getAll());
 *           addAll(Address.getAll());
 *       }})
 *      .wherePartiallyMatches("john")
 *      .orderBy(asc(ContactsFields.DisplayNamePrimary))
 *      .offset(5)
 *      .limit(10)
 *      .find();
 * ```

     * [android.provider.ContactsContract.SyncColumns] required to determine the

     * ## Developer Notes
     *
     * This API DOES NOT support ordering by Data table columns ([Fields]). It used to support it

     * Contacts table fields ([ContactsFields]).
     *
     * **If this supported ordering by Data table fields**, then it would be unable to use the
     * ORDER BY, LIMIT, and OFFSET functions of a raw database query and custom ordering via
     * Comparators is required.
     *
     * The Data table uses generic column names (e.g. data1, data2, ...) using the column 'mimetype'
     * to distinguish the type of data in that generic column. For example, the column name of
     * [NameFields.DisplayName] is the same as [AddressFields.FormattedAddress], which is 'data1'.
     * This means that if you order by the display name, you are also ordering by the formatted
     * address and all other columns whose value is 'data1'. This API could work around this
     * limitation by performing the ordering, limiting, and offsetting manually after
     * **all matching** contacts have been retrieved before returning it to the consumer.
     *
     * Note that there is no workaround for the [include] function because the
     * [ContentResolver.query] function only takes in an array of column names. This means that
     * including [NameFields.DisplayName] ('data1') will also result in the inclusion of
     * [AddressFields.FormattedAddress] ('data1').
