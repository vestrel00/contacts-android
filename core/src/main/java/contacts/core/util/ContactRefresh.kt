/**
 * Returns the contact with all of the latest data, including all RawContacts.
 *
 * This is useful for getting the latest contact data after performing an update. This may return
 * null if the Contact no longer exists or if permission is not granted.
 *
 * Supports profile and non-profile Contacts with native/custom data.
 *
 * ## Contact linking/unlinking and changing Accounts
 *
 * Note that this uses the [ExistingContactEntity.lookupKey] (**if available**) instead of the
 * [ExistingContactEntity.id] to fetch the Contact. The ID may change due to sync or aggregation.
 * You may use this function to refresh a Contact reference that you are holding on to for longer
 * periods of time. For example,
 *
 * - Saving/restoring activity/fragment instance state.
 * - Saving to an external database, preferences, or files.
 * - Creating shortcuts.
 *
 * This function will still return the correct Contact. It is able to do this using the
 * [ExistingContactEntity.lookupKey] with query APIs.
 *
 * If the Contact's constituent RawContact(s) changes Accounts, this may return null. This is the
 * same behavior as the AOSP and Google Contacts app.
 *
 * If the lookupKey of this instance is null, then it was probably not included in the query. In
 * this case, the ID will be used instead.
 *
 * **Important!** If this is a reference to a Contact with two or more constituent RawContacts
 * and the Contact has been unlinked (thereby creating separate Contact instances), this will only
 * return one of the Contacts it finds instead of all of the previously linked contacts. Use the
 * [contacts.core.Query] API in conjunction with the lookup key instead of this function.
 *
 * ## Permissions
 *
 * The [contacts.core.ContactsPermissions.READ_PERMISSION] is required.
 *
 * ## Cancellation
 *
 * To cancel this operation at any time, the [cancel] function should return true.
 *
 * This is useful when running this function in a background thread or coroutine.
 *
 * ## Thread Safety
 *
 * This should be called in a background thread to avoid blocking the UI thread.
