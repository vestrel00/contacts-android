/**
 * Deletes one or more groups from the groups table.
 *
 * ## Group memberships are automatically deleted
 *
 * When a group is deleted, any memberships to that group are deleted automatically by the
 * Contacts Provider.
 *
 * ## Deletion is not guaranteed to be immediate
 *
 * **Groups may not immediately be deleted**. They are marked for deletion and get deleted  in the
 * background by the Contacts Provider depending on sync settings and network availability.
 *
 * Group **memberships** to those groups marked for deletion are immediately deleted!
 *
 * ### Starred in Android (Favorites)
 *
 * When a Contact is starred, the Contacts Provider automatically adds a group membership to the
 * favorites group for all RawContacts linked to the Contact. Setting the Contact starred to false
 * removes all group memberships to the favorites group.
 *
 * The Contact's "starred" value is interdependent with group memberships to the favorites group.
 * Adding a group membership to the favorites group results in starred being set to true. Removing
 * the membership sets it to false.
 *
 * Raw contacts that are not associated with an account may or may not have any group memberships.
 * Even though these RawContacts may not have a membership to a favorites group, they may still be
 * "starred" (favorited), which is not dependent on the existence of a favorites group membership.
 *
 * **Refresh RawContact instances after changing the starred value.** Otherwise, performing an
 * update on the RawContact with a stale set of group memberships may revert the star/unstar
 * operation. For example,
 *
 * -> query returns a starred RawContact
 * -> set starred to false
 * -> update RawContact (still containing a group membership to the favorites group)
 * -> starred will be set back to true.
 *
 * ## Permissions
 *
 * The [ContactsPermissions.WRITE_PERMISSION] is assumed to have been granted already in these
 * examples for brevity. All deletes will do nothing if the permission is not granted.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * To delete the given groups,
 *
 * In Kotlin,
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val result = groupsDelete.groups(groups).commit()
 * ```
 *
 * In Java,
 *
 * ```java
 * GroupsDelete.Result result = groupsDelete.groups(groups).commit();
 * ```
