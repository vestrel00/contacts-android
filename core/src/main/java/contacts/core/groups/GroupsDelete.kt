/**
 * Deletes one or more groups from the groups table.
 *
 * ## Group memberships are automatically deleted
 *
 * When a group is deleted, any membership to that group is deleted automatically by the
 * Contacts Provider.
 *
 * ## Deletion is not immediate
 *
 * **Groups are not immediately deleted**. However, they are marked for deletion and they do get
 * deleted in the background by the Contacts Provider depending on sync settings.
 *
 * However, group memberships to those groups marked for deletion are immediately deleted!
 *
 * ### Starred in Android (Favorites)
 *
 * When a Contact is starred, the Contacts Provider automatically adds a group membership to the
 * favorites group for all RawContacts linked to the Contact. Setting the Contact starred to false
 * removes all group memberships to the favorites group.
 *
 * The Contact's "starred" value is interdependent with group memberships to the favorites group.
 * Adding a group membership to the favorites group results in starred being set to true. Removing
 * the membership sets it to false.
 *
 * Raw contacts that are not associated with an account do not have any group memberships. Even
 * though these RawContacts may not have a membership to the favorites group, they may still be
 * "starred" (favorited), which is not dependent on the existence of a favorites group membership.
 *
 * **Refresh RawContact instances after changing the starred value.** Otherwise, performing an
 * update on the RawContact with a stale set of group memberships may revert the star/unstar
 * operation. For example,
 *
 * -> query returns a starred RawContact
 * -> set starred to false
 * -> update RawContact (still containing a group membership to the favorites group)
 * -> starred will be set back to true.
 *
 * ## Permissions
 *
 * The [ContactsPermissions.WRITE_PERMISSION] is assumed to have been granted already in these
 * examples for brevity. All deletes will do nothing if the permission is not granted.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * To delete the given groups;
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * groupsDelete
 *      .groups(groups)
 *      .commit()
 * ```
 *
 * ## Notes
 *
 * Prior to Android 8.0 (Oreo, API 26), group deletion is unpredictable. Groups that are marked for
 * deletion remain in the DB and is still shown in the native Contacts app. Sometimes they do get
 * deleted at some point but the trigger for the actual deletion eludes me.
 *
 * The native Contacts app (prior to API 26) does NOT support group deletion perhaps because groups
 * syncing isn't implemented or at least not to the same extent as contacts syncing. Therefore, this
 * library will also not support group deletion for API versions lower than 26.
 *
 * DO NOT USE THIS ON API VERSION BELOW 26! Or use at your own peril =)
