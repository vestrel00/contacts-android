 * A membership to a group.

 * A RawContact may have 0, 1, or more entries of this data kind.
 *
 * Local RawContacts (those that are not associated with an Account) **should not** have any entries
 * of this data kind.
 *
 * ## Notes
 *
 * In more recent versions of Android, the native Contacts app presents group memberships
 * in the UI as "labels".
 *
 * There is no mutable version of a group membership. To make modifications to group memberships,
 * set the group memberships in the MutableRawContact. To select a set of group memberships, use
 * the [contacts.core.groups.GroupsQuery] with the same account as the RawContact and convert the
 * desired groups to group memberships via the functions in [contacts.core.util.newMembership].

 *

 * This is why there are no interfaces for NewGroupMembershipEntity, ExistingGroupMembershipEntity,

 * library functions or constructs that require them.
