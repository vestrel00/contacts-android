/**
 * A data kind representing a photo for the (raw) contact.
 *
 * A RawContact may have 0 or 1 entry of this data kind.
 *
 * **This class is internal** as it is of no use to consumers.
 *
 * Consumers may use the ContactPhoto and RawContactPhoto extension functions to get/set/remove
 * photos and thumbnails.
 *
 * ## Dev notes
 *
 * This class does not have any real functional value. This exist only to prevent RawContacts from
 * being considered blanks, which may result in unwanted deletion in updates. Instances of this have
 * no data but is never blank.
 *
 * Note that this is a class instead of an object to prevent future internal and consumer side
 * refactorings in case we need to add state. Also, Parcelize does not work on objects.
