/**
 * [Entity] that holds data modeling columns in the Contacts table.
 *
 * ## Contact, RawContact, and Data
 *
 * A Contact may consist of one or more RawContact. A RawContact is an association between a Contact
 * and an [android.accounts.Account]. Each RawContact is associated with several pieces of Data such
 * as name, emails, phone, address, and more.
 *
 * The Contacts Provider may combine RawContacts from several different Accounts. The same effect
 * is achieved when merging / linking multiple contacts.
 *
 * It is possible for a RawContact to not be associated with an Account. Such RawContacts are local
 * to the device and are not synced.
 */
sealed interface ContactEntity : Entity {

    /**
     * A list of [RawContactEntity]s that are associated with this contact.
     *
     * This list is sorted by RawContact id, which seems to be the sort order used by the native
     * Contacts app when displaying the linked RawContacts and when inserting new data for a Contact
     * with multiple linked RawContacts.
     */
    val rawContacts: List<RawContactEntity>

    /**
     * The standard text shown as the contact's display name, based on the best available
     * information for the contact (for example, it might be the email address if the name is not
     * available). This may be null if the Contacts Provider cannot find a suitable display name
     * source to use.
     *
     * This is the contact name displayed by the native Contacts app when viewing a contact. If a
     * Contact consists of more than one RawContact, then it is up to the Contacts Provider to
     * choose the display name to from the associated RawContacts.
     *
     * The contacts provider is free to choose whatever representation makes most sense for its
     * target market. For example in the default Android Open Source Project implementation, if the
     * display name is based on the [Name] and the [Name] follows the Western full-name style, then
     * this field contains the "given name first" version of the full name.
     *
     * This is a read-only attribute as the Contacts Provider automatically sets this value.
     * This is ignored for insert, update, and delete functions.
     *
     * ## [ContactEntity.displayNamePrimary] vs [Name.displayName]
     *
     * The [ContactEntity.displayNamePrimary] may be different than [Name.displayName]. If a [Name]
     * in the Data table is not provided, then other kinds of data will be used as the Contact's
     * display name. For example, if an [Email] is provided but no [Name] then the display name will
     * be the email. When a [Name] is inserted, the Contacts Provider automatically updates the
     * [ContactEntity.displayNamePrimary].
     *
     * If data rows suitable to be a [ContactEntity.displayNamePrimary] are not available, it will
     * be null.
     *
     * Data suitable to be a Contacts row display name are;
     *
     * - [Organization]
     * - [Email]
     * - [Name]
     * - [Nickname]
     * - [Phone]
     *
     * ## Display name may change upon data updates
     *
     * The native Contacts app also sets the most recently updated name as the default at every update
     * (and new Contact creation). This results in the Contact display name changing to the most
     * recently updated name from one of the associated RawContacts. The "most recently updated name"
     * is the name field that was last updated by the user when editing in the Contacts app, which is
     * irrelevant to its value. It does not matter if the user deleted the last character of the name,
     * added back the same character (undo), and then saved. It still counts as the most recently
     * updated. This logic is not implemented in this library. It is up to the consumers to implement it
     * or not, or do it differently.

 *

 * This interface is used for library functions that require a ContactEntity with an ID, which means
 * that it exists in the database. There are two variants of this; Contact and MutableContact.
 * With this, we can create functions (or extensions) that can take in (or have as the receiver)
 * either Contact or MutableContact through the ExistingContactEntity abstraction/facade.
 *
 * This is why there are no interfaces for NewContactEntity, ImmutableContactEntity, and
 * MutableContactEntity. There are currently no library functions or constructs that require them.

 * Please update this documentation if new abstractions are created.
