    /**
     * The full, unstructured postal address. This must be consistent with any structured data.
     *
     * The [formattedAddress] is the unstructured representation of the postal address. It is made
     * up of structured components; [street], [poBox], [neighborhood], [city], [region], [postcode],
     * and [country].
     *
     * ## Insert/update operations
     *
     * You have three different options when inserting/updating an [AddressEntity],
     *
     * 1. If the [formattedAddress] is null and there are non-null structured components provided
     *    (e.g. [street] and [city]), the Contacts Provider will automatically set the
     *   [formattedAddress] by combining the structured components.
     *
     * 2. If the [formattedAddress] is not null and all structured components are null, the Contacts
     *   Provider automatically (to the best of its ability) sets the values for all the structured
     *   components.
     *
     * 3. If the [formattedAddress] and structured components are not null, the Contacts Provider
     *    does nothing automatically.
     *
     * #### Important things to know about
     *
     * If your app only allows users to update the structured components and not the combined
     * [formattedAddress], you should set the [formattedAddress] to null when performing an update.
     * This means **option 1 is for you**. Otherwise, if you are trying to set all structured
     * components to null but you leave the [formattedAddress] not null, the Contacts Provider will
     * automatically set the value(s) of the structured components to a derived value from the
     * [formattedAddress]. In effect, your app would seemingly not allow users to clear the address.
     *
     * If your app only allows users to update the [formattedAddress] and not the structured
     * components, you should set the structured components to null when performing an update. This
     * means **option 2 is for you**. Otherwise, if you are trying to set the [formattedAddress] to
     * null but you leave the structured components not null, the Contacts Provider will
     * automatically set the value of the [formattedAddress] to a combined value from the structured
     * components. In effect, your app would seemingly not allow users to clear the
     * [formattedAddress].
     *
     * If you want to manually update both the [formattedAddress] and structured components with
     * your own custom algorithm, you may do so at your own discretion =)

/* DEV NOTES: Necessary Abstractions
 *
 * We only create abstractions when they are necessary!
 *
 * Apart from AddressEntity, there is only one interface that extends it; MutableAddressEntity.
 *
 * The MutableAddressEntity interface is used for library constructs that require an AddressEntity
 * that can be mutated whether it is already inserted in the database or not. There are two
 * variants of this; MutableAddress and NewAddress. With this, we can create constructs that can
 * keep a reference to MutableAddress(es) or NewAddress(es) through the MutableAddressEntity
 * abstraction/facade.
 *
 * This is why there are no interfaces for NewAddressEntity, ExistingAddressEntity, and
 * ImmutableAddressEntity. There are currently no library functions or constructs that require them.
 *
 * Please update this documentation if new abstractions are created.
