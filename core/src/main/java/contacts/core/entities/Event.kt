/* DEV NOTES: Necessary Abstractions
 *
 * We only create abstractions when they are necessary!
 *
 * Apart from EventEntity, there is only one interface that extends it; MutableEventEntity.
 *
 * The MutableEventEntity interface is used for library constructs that require an EventEntity
 * that can be mutated whether it is already inserted in the database or not. There are two
 * variants of this; MutableEvent and NewEvent. With this, we can create constructs that can
 * keep a reference to MutableEvent(s) or NewEvent(s) through the MutableEventEntity
 * abstraction/facade.
 *
 * This is why there are no interfaces for NewEventEntity, ExistingEventEntity, and
 * ImmutableEventEntity. There are currently no library functions or constructs that require them.
 *
 * Please update this documentation if new abstractions are created.
