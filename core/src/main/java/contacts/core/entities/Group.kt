     * Samsung and Xiaomi devices use non-null for the account name and type of local RawContacts

     * with this name and type.

     * #### Notes
     *
     * In the AOSP Contacts app, when there are no available accounts, no group may exist. As a
     * result, the AOSP Contacts app does not display the groups field when creating or updating
     * raw contacts when there are no available accounts present.
     *
     * On the other hand, other Contacts applications such as Google Contacts allows groups to exist
     * without an association to an account.
     *
     * Therefore, this library will allow groups to exist without an account. The responsibility of
     * allowing or disallowing groups to exist without an account is up to the application.

    /**
     * Similar to [RawContactEntity.sourceId], this is a String that uniquely identifies this row to
     * its source account.
     *
     * The source ID will be null if the RawContact is not associated/managed by an [account] that
     * has a sync adapter that assigns a non-null value to it.
     *
     * ## Not guaranteed to be immediate!
     *
     * When a [NewGroup] is inserted with a [NewGroup.account] that has a sync adapter, this
     * property may be set to a non-null value. The final value of this property may be assigned at
     * a later time, when the sync adapter performs a sync. This means that the value of this may be
     * null or assigned a non-null temporary value right after insertion but may change
     * once the sync as occurred.
     *
     * ## For sync adapter use only!
     *
     * Applications should NOT set/modify the value of this property!
     *
     * Setting the value for this property at the time of insertion or updating its value afterwards
     * is typically only done in the context of sync adapters. This is not for general app use!
     *
     * Do NOT mess with this unless you know exactly what you are doing. Otherwise, it WILL cause
     * issues with syncing with respect to the Account's sync adapter and remote servers/databases.
     *
     * ## Other things to note
     *
     * Surprisingly, setting/modifying this value does not require
     * [android.provider.ContactsContract.CALLER_IS_SYNCADAPTER] to be set to true. This means that
     * regular applications can set/modify it... The best we can do is document this.

/* DEV NOTES: Necessary Abstractions
 *
 * We only create abstractions when they are necessary!
 *
 * Apart from GroupEntity, there is only one interface that extends it; ExistingGroupEntity.
 * This interface is used for library functions that require a GroupEntity with an ID, which means
 * that it exists in the database. There are two variants of this; Group and MutableGroup.
 * With this, we can create functions (or extensions) that can take in (or have as the receiver)
 * either Group or MutableGroup through the ExistingGroupEntity abstraction/facade.
 *
 * This is why there are no interfaces for NewGroupEntity, ImmutableGroupEntity, and
 * MutableGroupEntity. There are currently no library functions or constructs that require them.
 *
 * Please update this documentation if new abstractions are created.
