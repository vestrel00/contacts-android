# How do I setup the Contacts API?

The main library functions are all accessible via the `contacts.core.Contacts` API.

There's no setup required. Just create an instance of `Contacts` and the world of contacts is at
your disposal =)

In Kotlin,

```kotlin
Contacts(context)
```

in Java,

```java
ContactsFactory.create(context);
```

> The `context` parameter can come from anywhere; Application, Activity, Fragment, or View. It does
> not matter what context you pass in. The API will only use and store the Application context, to
> avoid leaks :D

It's up to you if you just want to create instances on demand. Or, hold on to instances as a 
[singleton][singleton] that is injected to your dependency graph (via something like 
[dagger][dagger], [hilt][hilt], or [koin][koin]), which will make 
[black box testing][black-box-testing] and [white box testing][white-box-testing] a walk in the
park!

## Logging support

Instances of `Contacts` hold on to a `Logger` for logging support.

For more info, read [How do I log API input and output?](/howto/howto-log-api-input-output.md)

## Custom data integration

Instances of `Contacts` hold on to an instance of `CustomDataRegistry` for custom data integration.

For more info, read [How do I integrate custom data?](/howto/howto-integrate-custom-data.md)

## Optional, but recommended setup

It is recommended to use a single instance of the `Contacts` API throughout your application using 
[dependency injection][di]. This will allow you to;

1. Use the same `Contacts` API instance throughout your app.
    - This especially important when integrating custom data.
2. Easily substitute your `Contacts` API instance with an instance of `TestContacts`.
    - This is useful in [black box testing][black-box-testing] (UI instrumentation tests; `androidTest/`).
    - It may also be used in your production apps "test mode".
3. Easily substitute your `Contacts` API instance with an instance of `MockContacts`
    - This is useful in [white box testing][white-box-testing] (unit & integration tests; `test/`).
