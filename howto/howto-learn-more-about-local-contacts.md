# How do I learn more about "local" (device-only) contacts?

Contacts, or more specifically RawContacts, that are not associated with an
`android.accounts.Account` are local to each device and will not be synced across devices.

This means that any RawContacts you create, update, or delete will NOT be synced on any device or
remote service as it is not associated with any account.

## Associating a local RawContact to an Account

Local RawContacts can be associated to an Account to enable syncing.

## Adding an Account to the device

Depending on the API level, the Contacts Provider behaves differently when the user adds an account
to the device.

**Lollipop (API 22) and below**

When an Account is added, from a state where no accounts have yet been added to the system, the
Contacts Provider automatically sets all of the null `accountName` and `accountType` in the
RawContacts table to that Account's name and type.

RawContacts inserted without an associated account will automatically get assigned to an account if
there are any available. This may take a few seconds, whenever the Contacts Provider decides to do
it. Dissociating RawContacts from Accounts will result in the Contacts Provider associating those
back to an Account.

**Marshmallow (API 23) and above**

The Contacts Provider no longer associates local RawContacts to an account when an account is or
becomes available. Local contacts remain local.

**Account removal**

Removing the Account will remove all of the associated rows in the RawContact, Data, and Groups 
tables **locally**. This includes user Profile data in those tables.

> Note that when all RawContacts of a Contact is removed, the Contact is also automatically removed
> by the Contacts Provider.

## Data kinds Account restrictions

Entries of some data kinds should not be allowed to exist for local RawContacts.

> The native Contacts app hides the following UI fields when inserting or updating local 
> RawContacts. To enforce this behavior, this library ignores all of the above during inserts and 
> updates for local raw contacts.

These data kinds are;

- `GroupMembership`
    - Groups can only exist if it is associated with an Account. Therefore, memberships to groups is
      not possible when there is no associated Account.
- `Event`
    - It is not clear why this requires an associated Account. Maybe because these are typically
      birth dates that users expect to be synced with their calendar across devices?
- `Relation`
    - It is not clear why this requires an associated Account...

The Contacts Provider may or may not enforce these Account restrictions. However, the native
Contacts app imposes these restrictions. Therefore, this library also imposes these restrictions and
disables consumers from violating them.
