/**
 * An [ImageView] that displays a [ContactEntity]'s photo and handles photo addition, modification,
 * and removal.
 *
 * Setting the [contact] will automatically update the views. Any modifications in the views will
 * also be made to the [contact]'s photo upon [savePhoto] (only if it is mutable).
 *
 * ## Note
 *
 * This is a very rudimentary view that is not styled or made to look good. It may not follow any
 * good practices and may even implement bad practices. Consumers of the library may choose to use
 * this as is or simply as a reference on how to implement this part of AOSP Contacts app.
 *
 * This does not support state retention (e.g. device rotation). The OSS community may contribute to
 * this by implementing it.
 *
 * The community may contribute by styling and adding more features and customizations with these
 * views if desired.
 *
 * ## Developer Notes
 *
 * I usually am a proponent of passive views and don't add any logic to views. However, I will make
 * an exception for this basic view that I don't really encourage consumers to use.
 *
 * This is in the sample and not in the contacts-ui module because it requires concurrency. We
 * should not add coroutines and contacts-async as dependencies to contacts-ui just for this.
 * Consumers may copy and paste this into their projects or if the community really wants it, we may
 * move this to a separate module (contacts-ui-async).
